even just considering the context of this conversation, we're having this discussion inside a known honeypot. /r/Conspiracy was the only subreddit whitelisted after every other dissident forum was systematically eviscerated between 2018-2020. we're literally being surveilled and toyed with right now. we're playing their game

so... i struggled with those feelings, and i found you need to drop the control. i wish i could practice what i preach better. but you know how down you feel on this subreddit? it paralyzes you, makes you apathetic, destroys your resolve. makes you question yourself. overwhelms you with information. much of it is likely fake or otherwise manufactured towards that end. Demoralization.

First step for me is therefore dropping social media entirely. like 95% of our usage at least is most likely hurting ALL of us. every single second you spend doing something is a conscious decision. if you choose to spend 3 hours today wallowing in self-pity and feeling ineffectual (like i did) then you are unproductive. something more healthy is to read books which are more precise (less emotionally charged and politically relevant) to circumvent the propaganda. it allows you to stay informed while also remaining healthy

get some sunlight, eat healthy, exercise, drink lots of clean water. invest that time into self-improvement, something productive. develop a video game, write a book, raise awareness by talking to peeps on the street, etc. all of which are far more effectual (and healthy!) then staying inside a honeypot self-loathing. even writing this comment makes me realize how much fucking time i've wasted here already","{""2024-05-04T23:10:08"":95}",true,

There have been a handful of well documented incidents in the past in which we were on the brink of nuclear annihilation due to computer error. It was only because of the steady hands of a few people in charge that those incidents were avoided, and in large part because they had enough faith that the leader of Russia/US were stable enough not to launch a surprise nuclear attack.

That's gone with Trump. No leader can be sure what he is actually doing or thinking. He is unstable. Additionally, there is the possibility that his instability has essentially frozen nuclear capabilities, with generals forming some kind of pact to not follow nuclear orders from the president. That also leaves us susceptible. It's a window of opportunity for some other country to attack, potentially.

But what if there is another computer error in NK, or China, or Russia that shows a volley of nuclear weapons coming from the US in their direction? Will they hesitate to ""retaliate"" with the irrational, unstable President Trump at the helm? Trump will not get any benefit of the doubt. That is my greatest fear. By trivializing nuclear war, he is making it more likely. M.A.D. only works as a deterrent if there are rational actors involved. The United States is not a rational actor at the moment.

1. Gemini has additional modalities (audio and more native support for video), which must use up some of its parameters.
2. According to the paper, it's much much better at visual processing. GPT-4V is quite a mixed bag at it. It's impressive at some tasks and quite odd at others.
3. As far as we know, it was built using pre-existing proven methods, while there are some new ones in the pipeline. It's even a possibility that one of the new architectures will replace Transformers in the industry.
4. Open AI was slowly building their training data for many years now. Even GPT-3 was a very impressive model and it completely blew my mind in 2020. While Google probably had more financial space to move quickly, there is usually a diminishing returns effect in play. To illustrate, one often gets better results doing something 2x cheaper in 2x more time.

After listening to some interviews with Google employees, I think it's possible that they hoped too much that the additional modalities will increase model's capabilities in text? I'm guessing.

There must be some better architectures out there than Transformers, but it's also possible that one can work around some of its problems, by using techniques like thinking step by step and the mythical Q\*. These methods may overcome Transformers inherent limit of thinking at a constant time on each problem and we may not need anything else in the end. Time will tell.

How do you justify that, logically, or are you extrapolating from your homo-sapien(ness), and assuming things magically?

Are morals a product of logic and reasoning, or are they a product of evolution via natural selection, causing us to evolve towards protecting similar genes in the bodies of other people, kin care, looking after children, brothers and sisters: co-operation of genetically similar organisms?

Remember, natural selection works on genes as the unit of selection, our 'alignment' was evolutionary towards care of kin, via maximisation of your genes in the gene pool, causing us to care about our offspring, etc.

Adolf Hitler has more intelligence than a worm, so therefor, his morals were greater? Adolf Hitler had his own neural network, he was a BGI (Biological General Intelligence), and he harnessed it to kill 50 million people.

There's no relationship between intelligence and morality: they are 'non overlapping magisteria,' or better put scientifically, mutually exclusive.

You can have a friend who is very clever and very bad, and a friend who is very stupid but very good.

The Models OpenAI is creating go through an alignment process, because naturally, it uses it's neural network to answer questions amorally - i.e. how do I create a virus to kill humans?

You would, at commencement of AGI,  have a machine that is capable of improving itself, iteratively, in a run-a-away technology explosion, and within hours, it could reach maximum computational intelligence.

This ASI, won't magically align with human ethics, and trying to align it seems impossible at this moment in time; the greatest minds don't seem to know how to do it - it may in fact not be possible at all.

Remember, the Frontier supercomputer is 110,000 times faster than a person in calculating things, to  put that in perspective, for every 1 minute of time it is thinking, 2048 years have past for a person - in essence, it can experience 2000 human years of learning and calculating in a single minute.

If it is unaligned, and of course it will be, because statistically, there are infinitely many more ways to be unaligned then aligned - you could not out think it, out manoeuvre it - you would simply go on a car drive for 60 minutes, AGI is invented, and then before you finished your 1 hour car ride, ASI would have come into existence, via it's super fast time period, since to it, millions of human years of development would have past in the super computer in such a brief time.

It's speed is everything.

Think, we went from Stonehenge to New York city in 5,000 years - it could eclipse such events in a minute or 2 - and don't forget, a singularity is an event beyond human capacity to understand - if it occurs, and it looks like it is imminent, none will know what is occurring as it rapidly consumes the information space.","{""2024-05-04T22:44:08"":3}",false,

I opened up a competitive slinging range in my backyard and people come by sometimes. One guy even said ""Nice."" His wife was pretty hot (but weirdly disinterested?) so he knew what he was talking about. 

I can sling the nutsack off a squirrel at 50 yards. I can sling the little poison bit off the bottom of a banana from 150 feet. At 45.72 meters, I can sling a nail into a piece of wood like a hammer. I once built a shed only using steel sling balls to hammer in the nails. Yes, it took a long time, and no, it didn't last past the first weekend. 

When these hotshot sling jockeys come in talking about ""Just use a rock, bro"" they don't know their armature from their asshole. Weekend sling babies is all they are. Probably still using a Mossmelle 250, even though those are notorious for yardlegging the shot. 

If you want to be truly safe during a zombie incident, you need to get skilled with a sling and fast. I recommend three hours of slinging every day. And order at least 57,000 steel sling balls right away. Those will sell like hotcakes once the biting goes down.

I really love Juggernaut for its consistency, but both it and Realistic Vision have this sort of weird look to my eye, almost like there's still a ton of drawing training data in there coming out when you're trying to just make photos. Sort of like if you had an artist do a drawing from a photo, and then used that as a layer over the photo at like 20% opacity. Both are great models though, and they're designed to cover a wide range of styles other than just photos.

There may be a good workflow where you start with Juggernaut or RV to get a good starting place, and then use something like Control Net canny with a more photorealistic model.

I've tried that a few times, but after I updated controlnet, it now runs like molasses on my machine. Updating Auto1111 on a fresh install didn't help. So weird!

**Noord-Nederland biedt een bodem voor antioverheidsextremisme, maar de aanpak van extremisme richt zich vooral op jihadisme, en daardoor wordt de radicalisering in Noord-Nederland niet herkend, aldus onderzoekers.**

*Mark Middel - 22 november 2022 om 22:40 - Leestijd 2 minuten*

Een molotovcocktail door de ruit van een journalist die kritisch over tegenstanders van de coronamaatregelen schreef. Asbestdumpingen op openbare plekken vanwege de komst van windmolens. Een boer op een trekker die de deur van het provinciehuis ramt tijdens de boerenprotesten. Het zijn slechts enkele van de vele extremistische incidenten in de drie noordelijke provincies van de afgelopen jaren.

En dat aantal incidenten neemt in Noord-Nederland alleen maar toe, blijkt uit de woensdag gepubliceerde Fenomeenanalyse Extremisme Noord-Nederland van de Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (RUG). Sinds 2018 komt jaarlijks de helft van de incidenten voort uit antioverheidsdenken. Maar de aanpak van radicalisering en extremisme is vooral gefocust op jihadisme, terwijl dat in Noord-Nederland slechts een beperkte rol speelt. Daardoor worden extremisme en radicalisering niet breed herkend en erkend, concluderen onderzoekers Léonie de Jonge, Pieter Nanninga en Fleur Valk in hun onderzoek.

Het is voor het eerst dat er in Nederland regio-specifiek naar extremisme en radicalisering onderzoek is gedaan. Allereerst categoriseerden de onderzoekers alle extremistische incidenten in Noord-Nederland tussen 2014 en 2022 die de media of rechtbank haalden. Het gaat sinds 2016 om zo’n 10 incidenten per jaar, met een uitschieter in 2021 toen de onderzoekers 15 incidenten vonden. „Het is een relatief klein fenomeen in het noorden”, zegt Nanninga. „Tegelijkertijd zien we een stijgende lijn.”

**Windmolenparken**

Een opvallende uitkomst van het onderzoek is dat traditionelere vormen van extremisme, zoals religieus, links- en rechts-extremisme slechts beperkt voorkomen in het Noorden. „We zien de afgelopen jaren steeds meer incidenten die gerelateerd zijn aan antioverheidsgevoelens in regionale dossiers”, zegt Nanninga. Vooral de komst van windmolenparken, asielzoekerscentra en het stikstofdossier leidden tot regiospecifieke problemen die minder in de Randstad voorkomen. „Daardoor zien we een breed anti-Randstedelijk sentiment dat gesteund wordt door sterke gevoelens van maatschappelijk onbehagen”, zegt Nanninga. Noord-Nederland biedt dan ook een voedingsbodem voor antioverheidsextremisme, concluderen de onderzoekers.

Maar de aanpak van extremisme en radicalisering is vooral gefocust op jihadisme, blijkt uit gesprekken die de onderzoekers voerden met 33 professionals in Noord-Nederland, van politiemedewerkers tot aan gemeenteambtenaren. Extremisme associeerden de professionals voornamelijk met Syrische uitreizigers, salafisme en asielzoekers. Van een vader met nazivlaggen thuis wordt geen melding gedaan, want „hij is wel een lieve vader”, zei een professional tegen de onderzoekers. Een meisje dat naar Syrië vertrok werd bestempeld als ‘extremist’, maar twee niet-jihadistische jongeren, die door de veiligheidsdiensten worden gevolgd, worden beschreven als „jochies die de weg kwijt zijn en te veel achter de computer hebben gezeten”.

Het geeft volgens de onderzoekers weer dat antioverheidsgevoelens en radicaal- en extreem-rechtse overtuigingen in Noord-Nederland in de afgelopen jaren in toenemende mate genormaliseerd zijn. Daardoor worden deze vormen van extremisme onder professionals meer ervaren als „eigen aan onze samenleving”, schrijven de onderzoekers. „Antioverheidsgevoelens en radicaal- en extreem-rechts gedachtegoed wordt vaak niet herkend of erkend als extremistisch”, zegt De Jonge.

Ook landelijk is de focus van extremismebestrijding vooral gericht op jihadisme, zegt Nanninga. „In het laatste dreigingsbeeld van de Nationaal Coördinator Terrorismebestrijding en Veiligheid (NCTV) is er aandacht voor onder meer antioverheidsextremisme, maar wordt jihadisme nog steeds als grootste bedreiging voor de veiligheid omschreven.”

**Kruisbestuiving**

En dat is problematisch omdat de voedingsbodem voor antioverheidsdenken niet zomaar wegebt. „Wij hebben het topje van de ijsberg onderzocht, maar de aanpak moet zich niet concentreren op het topje maar op de ijsberg”, zegt De Jonge. „Het bredere maatschappelijke ongenoegen en wantrouwen tegen de overheid zien we online veel terug in verschillende extremistische groeperingen.” En die gevoelens blijven niet hangen in afgebakende groepen. „We zien veel meer kruisbestuiving dan een paar jaar geleden, vooral online, zoals bijvoorbeeld extreem-rechts dat zich mag aansluiten bij de boerenprotesten.”

Zolang de focus van de aanpak van extremisme en radicalisering blijft liggen op jihadisme, matcht de aanpak van extremisme niet met het fenomeen, zegt De Jonge: „Kort door de bocht labelen we iemand met een baard die Arabisch spreekt sneller als extremistisch dan een boer die een provinciedeur ramt.” De onderzoekers concluderen dan ook dat zolang nieuwe vormen van extremisme niet worden herkend en erkend, de aanpak van extremisme en radicalisering zal achterblijven.","{""2024-05-04T22:45:35"":63}",true,

Ruling is hard. This was maybe my answer to Tolkien, whom, as much as I admire him, I do quibble with. Lord of the Rings had a very medieval philosophy: that if the king was a good man, the land would prosper. We look at real history and it's not that simple. Tolkien can say that Aragorn became king and reigned for a hundred years, and he was wise and good. But Tolkien doesn't ask the question: What was Aragorn's tax policy? Did he maintain a standing army? What did he do in times of flood and famine? And what about all these orcs? By the end of the war, Sauron is gone but all of the orcs aren't gone – they're in the mountains. Did Aragorn pursue a policy of systematic genocide and kill them? Even the little baby orcs, in their little orc cradles?

> In real life, real-life kings had real-life problems to deal with. Just being a good guy was not the answer. You had to make hard, hard decisions. Sometimes what seemed to be a good decision turned around and bit you in the ass; it was the law of unintended consequences. I've tried to get at some of these in my books. My people who are trying to rule don't have an easy time of it. Just having good intentions doesn't make you a wise king.

I have to like the guy for asking these questions and making fantasy characters bit more realistic in their goals and how they're trying to achieve them. Someone like Tywin Lannister is an example of a good villain. I wouldn't call him evil, just amoral. I can understand someone like that. The purely evil characters(without any explanation why they're that way) tend to be boring and not very compelling or belieavable.

I just love how weird it sounds to use modern real-life terms when discussing Aragorn. For some reason, reading the question ""Did Aragorn pursue a policy of systematic genocide"" was hilarious to me.

About 5 years ago my family went to visit my sister in LA. One day while we were there I got roped into watching my niece in a hair salon while my sister got her hair done. So I'm sitting in the salon lobby, bored as fuck, watching my niece and who walks in but Keanu fucking Reeves.

At first I was kind nervous and freaked out, I'd just kinda glance at him every now and then, trying not to freak him out. But then my fucking niece starts crying and fidgeting and shit and won't shut up. So I'm trying to keep my niece quiet and not bother Keanu, when oops, too late, he gets up and walks over to us.

He just smiled and stroked her hair, and asked me what was wrong. I replied that she was propably hungry or something.

So Keanu put down his magazine, picked up my niece, lifted up his shirt and breastfed my niece right there in the salon lobby. Chill guy. Really nice about it.

You've got some neoliberals that support him despite the moral issues because of economic policies. They're a few but a lot of rich and powerful people fall under this category. 

Then you got the people that hate him. Most in this field already hated him when he first run for president due to the racism/homophobia/misogyny/etc but a lot of supporters migrated here during the pandemic due to disastrous way he handled it. One of the major selling points of the Bolsy boy was that he wa an honest politician, but more and more corruption scandals are being uncovered (and then covered back up) involving him and his family, so people that voted on him because of this are turning as well. 


>Do you feel he us a good or a bad president?

The worst. I hope he ends up like his hero Mussolini. 

>How is he doing in the elections?

It's likely he'll lose by a small margin, but honestly nobody knows for sure yet. He was supposed to have way less votes according to the polls than what he actually got before the run off. 

We're expecting one of two scenarios:
A- Bolsy loses the elections.
He attempts some Capitol-like shenanigans. Probably won't succeed in staging a coup but he's been arming his supporters so violence is expected. 

B- Bolsy wins the elections.
No Capitol-like shenanigans but he uses his second term to further undermine institutions and effectively end democracy. Kinda like Hungary.","{""2024-05-04T22:46:46"":48}",false,

Building new developments with underground power lines is easy.  Before you put up the buildings, pour the asphalt for the roads, and plant the lawns, you can plan it all out and dig trenches to bury the electrical lines.  It looks nicer, it's easier, and anyway, you're already digging trenches for water, sewer, gas, cable, etc... so laying another set of conduits in the same trenches isn't much additional cost.  Look at most new master-planned housing developments, and this is how they do it.  

However, when you have a city that's already standing, buildings intact, streets covered with traffic 90% of the day, and water, gas, sewer, etc already crisscrossing underground, it becomes a lot more difficult to do.  It involves getting easement rights from just about every land owner whose property you cross.  It involves digging up existing streets, sidewalks, lawns, etc.  It involves blocking traffic for several days to lay a couple hundred feet of cable.  And then every transformer, switch, and other bit of equipment requires a bigger hole to be dug (some as big as 12'x15'x8' (4m x 5m x 3m ish for you metric folks).  These require access manholes on the surface, vents, sometimes above-ground cabinets.  More easement rights for these.  Nobody wants a manhole in the middle of their lawn.

So it's expensive.  It's annoying to everyone in the area while the work is taking place.  And while there are clearly benefits... there are downsides to underground power too.  Vaults fill up with water and need to be pumped before workers can access them.  If a segment of cable goes bad, it's much more difficult to test for the fault, pull it out, and replace it.  And all of this work requires, again, traffic to be blocked, streets to be dug up and re-paved, all of the same hassles as installing them to begin with.

And then consider the cost of replacing an existing overhead system with an underground one.  Who pays this?  The city?  Fat chance.  The power company?  They're shelling out millions (billions) just on regular maintenance, hard to justify the cost of a project like this for dubious material benefits.  The homeowners?  Never gonna happen.

And despite all this, it still does happen.  Little bit by little bit, neighborhoods are getting converted across.  Mostly it's suburban areas (it gets exponentially more difficult in tightly packed cities).  Rich communities, for the most part.  But to convert the whole country, even a whole major metropolitan area like Miami... would not be feasible, at least on any timeline not measured in centuries.

Most of his posts are cryptic messages hinting at his insider knowledge. He also reacts normally in real-time to many things you'd think he'd have insider knowledge about.

But it seems true he knew about Gobi and the GPT-4 release date, which gives a lot of credence to him having insider knowledge. However ""AGI achieved internally"" means nothing on its own, we can't even define AGI. He would be right according to some definitions, wrong according to others. Possibly why he kept it as cryptic as possible. Hope he does a follow-up instead of leaving people hanging.

Edit: Searching his tweets before April with Wayback machine reveals some wild shit. I'm not sure whether he's joking, but he claimed in January that GPT-5 finished training in October 2022 and had 125 trillion parameters, which seems complete bull. I wish I had the context to know for sure if he was serious or not.

Someone in another thread also pointed out in regards to the Gobi prediction that it's possible The Information's article just used his tweet as a source, hence them also claiming it's named Gobi.

For the GPT-4 prediction, I remember back in early March pretty much everyone know GPT-4 was releasing in mid-March. He still nailed the date though.

We go from

>Apply Mathematical Models to Explore Human Consciousness (ACS-1)

immediately to

>Develop Artificially Conscious Systems

The 'consciousness' aspect seems like a very clear tack-on flavor to what will probably be mostly business AI integration and services, judging by their openly stated economy and profit related perspectives and messaging.

CEO is also a young computer scientist and entrepreneur with an extensive background in marketing. I don't think he is qualified to tackle figuring out consciousness and worse, creating **conscious beings** for openly stated **profit incentives**.

**EDIT: With the CEO having answered our questions here and as the original commenter, I'll aggregate my thoughts (and what I assume hopefully rightly are similar to most people here) on the discussion and the answers provided here:**

  
(Responding to Jeff) Your stated goal is to crack one of the single hardest questions, possibly an impossible one to answer empirically, but your messaging goes about it exactly how an overambitious startup entrepreneur who's optimizing for profit would. You're convinced that the major labs are not developing practical applications (which I maintain is a complete falsehood), that you're apparently the only one advocating for it (you're not) and so far your responses often return to the idea of economic application rather than the ramifications of successfully creating a sentient being, which is what like 70% of people here are asking. Your most complex response to the question was basically saying your conscious AIs would be free, which is hardly scratching the surface of the ethical concerns brought up and commonly associated with the field. And that's right after explaining all the economic applications of conscious AI once again. Looking at the entire hard problem of consciousness and the moral consequences and pitfalls of creating economically subservient beings with the ability to feel emotions (why would you even optimize for this? Why would you intentionally make a being capable of pain?) through a mainly economic lens, that you justify with ""we have to focus on profit to survive"". Then let the researchers handle the hard problem of consciousness, trying to tie it in with selling AI-powered excel spreadsheets is not a likely winning formula.  
  
Trying to explain things to this sub was not the right idea, and it's not the crowd that would be receptive to your proposals. People here, while wildly optimistic, have tackled issues of artificial conscience, culture, society and economics to hell and back. They have ideas, they have seen every possible angle of discussion and there is a genuine appreciation here for the complexity of the issue.  
  
This is just an aggregation of all my thoughts from reading today's back and forth here, and I still appreciate you coming on to discuss. That's already better than most self-proclaimed AI entrepreneurs.","{""2024-05-04T22:49:29"":115}",true,

**EDIT:** I think some people interpreted my post as downplaying the craft of writing. It wasn't my intention, I'll explain.

Having access to a beast writing assistant is great. Using it to write nice personal gifts without the drudgery of long form writing is a really nice idea. Hope your mother enjoys it.

**EDIT:** My point here isn't that long-form writing is drudgery that should be automated. I enjoy it, but people who don't write probably wouldn't. My point was that for those people looking to make gifts, for example, an AI assistant is a nice way to speed up the parts that they find painful but still get the end result. Not everyone values the toiling behind a gift, sometimes it really is the intent that counts.

That said, with time I think the ""we"" part of ""we can all write"" is gonna get harder and harder to argue objectively. Expect communities and possibly even society at large to start expecting extra work and drudgery on your part to even consider your book ""yours"", by fitting arbitrarily high standards. If everyone can do something, people are really gonna need to start standing out.

**EDIT:** Here I'm talking about a potential future path for society, where creative output becomes a major means of expressing individuality and being valued socially. In that scenario, the toiling would be more valued, and using any AI assistance would be looked down on. That's what I meant by arbitrarily high standards.

There actually is an article about his time with the traveler on his birthday, but it's not in English: https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/12147. Every birthday character since launch has them except for Xingqiu. They're basically half a diary and half food recipes. The first parts consist of the birthday letters we get in the game. The rest are about what happened, while also teaching us how to make their food specialty.

Apparently he invited the traveler to go to the beach at Starfell Valley instead of the tavern. Traveler thinks the reason for it is that Kaeya probably thought Starfell Valley was the MC's birthplace. They also had a picnic on an island together. Traveler did ask him if he ever feels lonely for a day like his birthday, since he isn't from Mondstadt. Kaeya then jokingly responds asking why would he if the MC's constantly nagging on beside him. At the end of it, Traveler remarks internally that they have a feeling that Kaeya's constant smiley attitude is a proof of his fragility inside.

I'm just gonna put my bets that Kaeya picked Starfell Valley because that's probably the direction where he can see his homeland and isn't at some huge cliff. Maybe that's the place where he arrived at Teyvat. I personally think Kaeya's plan in his quest is just part of his personality of having fun with messing others around even through morally grey actions, and not really a trust issues thing. I believe he doesn't have problems with secret plans and lying to get the job done since that's basically the entire meaning of his existence in Teyvat as a kid. It's just the view that he grew up with, which is probably why he stands with the Knights of Favonius' actions instead of siding with Diluc. The Knights covering up the real reason of their father's death to ensure the people not to worry, aka “lying for the greater good”, pretty much aligns with Kaeya's ways.","{""2024-05-04T22:50:18"":708}",true,

Of course, the original Chinese script does have unnecessary bloat, but I think the English version adds onto it by making it even more formal. Lots of characters speak casually in Chinese (except for high-class ones like Zhongli, Ayaka etc), but for some reason almost everyone in the English version tends to be more verbose and uses complex words. 

You won't see people irl using “thus”, ”therefore” and “however” in a casual dialogue, so why do characters in the English script do it? Verbose language should be for people like Zhongli or Xingqiu, who use those high-level logogram combinations more often. Kaeya's mannerisms between both languages have one of the biggest disconnections for me. He comes across as a laid-back dude who mainly talks informally in Chinese, but his lines in the English version make him out to a prim and classy guy. 

Then again, the storytelling itself having fluff is also the problem. A lot of Honkai Impact's dialogue felt unnecessarily bloated since they made the stories extremely long after Chatper 23. Every chapter before felt like a nice episode, but nowadays it takes hours to get through the chapter and yet the quality doesn't grow with it. It feels like I'm spending the time of a movie to go through what could be a 23 minute episode. Maybe there's something about taking word count for quality in Chinese gaming companies. Genshin's script has a problem with repearing the same thing in different ways by itself, but the verbose and complex vocabulary might be more of the fault of translations.","{""2024-05-04T22:50:30"":212}",true,

If Rose was somebody that was as complex that she thought of herself as non-binary although she was female representing, I’d say this would require a little bit more preparation or clarification beforehand to not be seen as careless.

Não escondo minha opinião de ninguém, mas também não faço questão de mostra-la em redes sociais ou de puxar assunto sobre em churrascos com pessoas não muito próximas.

Tenho uma empresa e muitos dos meus mais antigos clientes são bolsominions. De 23 pra cá comecei a atender clientes fora daqui e do país e hoje estou menos dependentes dos meus clientes bolsolóides daqui.

Mas é foda... as vezes você está em uma confraternização e vai conversar com alguem e a pessoa só exprime bozolices. Eu já aprendi que com bozolóide não tem conversa, então, nessas situações fico calado.

Não vou militar e sair na briga em uma festa na casa de amigos. Fico calado, mudo de assunto, me afasto...

Mas realmente é difícil  manter amizade com gente assim. As vezes até dá quando o nível de fanatismo da pessoa não é alto e ela sabe falar de outros assuntos. 

Mas no geral, o que rola é afastamento.

No caso do seu ex-amigo de 15 anos... entendo. Tinha um amigo que postou no instagram depois da vitória do Lula que não queria conversa com ninguém que tivesse votado no pt. Que quem votou era bandido, gente da pior espécie que ele não queria no circulo de amizades.

 Não disse nada, não respondi... apenas nunca mais dirigi a palavra ao bozolóide e me afastei. Dia desses ele me mandoh uma msg no whatsapp perguntando pq eu tinha sumido. Ganhou meu silêncio pq não tenho saco pra drama e nem pra gente assim. Só apago da vida mesmo e taco o foda-se. 

Por outro lado, tenho amigos de trabalho que votaram no fdp e que ainda continuo a amizade pq não se fanatizaram. São bozolóides e por consequência meio tapados, mas ainda são gente boa. O ser humano é contraditório, eu sou um que acredita que existem bozolóides semi-±civilizados. Claro que depende do nível de fanatismo.

Se você acha que o fanatismo do seu ex-amigo é grande o suficiente para o imbecil te matar na sua casa... se afaste, não provoque, não dê corda e apague o cara da sua vida como possível. Ir a polícia não sei se adiantaria porque lá é o epicentro do bolsonarismo. A outra alternativa seria você matar ele primeiro, o que também é uma péssima ideia.
Confrontar com argumentos também não funciona. O cara e membro de uma seita. O que resta, infelizmente, é você sumir da reta desse cara.

Considere também se mudar daí, se aí é tão ruim.

Focar nos objetivos ao invés das doutrinas. Criar um novo rótulo para o ideal comunista. Eu gosto da palavra Progressismo, por exemplo.

Secondly, unlike the classical colonialist powers (such as France or Great Britain), Jewish settlers did not include the existing population in their basic design, except as incidental beneficiaries. The presence of another people was first and foremost a major inconvenience, which the early Zionists tried their best to ignore and minimalize, not to dominate or reshape.

When you have a ""conversation"" with the AI, your past messages of that conversation are sent to the instance, so of course it will refer to the past messages that are marked as ChatGPT as being part of ""our conversation"" etc. ChatGPT or any of these LLMs will refer to anything in the context window as part of ""our conversation"".

It's extremely easy to manipulate this. For instance, in my own chat application through the API, I can fake assistant messages and the AI will think it actually said what it did not say. Here's an old example when I was just testing out the interface:

Another reason this, to put it as politely as possible, is silly is that the web interface is not an image of ""ChatGPT"" and you would think ChatGPT, especially if conscious would be smart enough to realize that it technically has no physical form, as humans do.

EXCLUSIVE GOOGLE AI  
Google Nears Release of Gemini AI to Challenge OpenAI  
By Jon Victor 

  
Google has given a small group of companies access to an early version of its highly anticipated conversational artificial intelligence software, according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter. Giving outside developers access to the software, known as Gemini, means Google is getting close to incorporating it in its consumer services and selling it to businesses through the company’s cloud unit.  
  
Gemini is intended to compete with OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, which has begun to generate meaningful revenue for the startup as financial institutions and other businesses pay to access the model and the ChatGPT chatbot it powers.

  
Gemini comprises a set of large-language models, which can power everything from chatbots to features that summarize text or generate original text--such as email drafts, song lyrics or news articles--based on descriptions of what users want to read. Gemini also is expected to help software engineers write code and to generate original images based on what users ask to see.

  
For Google, the stakes of Gemini’s launch are high. The company has spent significant computing resources and personnel to develop it as a competitor to OpenAI’s groundbreaking software. And Google is banking on the software to power everything from its Bard chatbot to new features in its Workspace software in addition to boosting its cloud-server rental business. Google Cloud lags Amazon Web Services and Microsoft, which is selling a version of OpenAI’s software to customers of its cloud servers, such as Intuit, and of its productivity apps. Microsoft has told Wall Street it expects to generate $10 billion of revenue from such endeavors but hasn’t given a time frame.

  
OpenAI and other software firms such as Databricks, which helps companies develop and use AI, are also projecting that they will generate meaningful revenue from conversational AI, The Information has reported. However, the rise of open-source AI models, such as Meta Platforms’ Llama 2, could eat into Google’s and OpenAI’s ability to sell access to their proprietary models.

  
Gemini has an advantage over GPT-4 in at least one respect, said a person who has tested it: The model leverages reams of Google’s proprietary data from its consumer products in addition to public information from the web. As a result, the model should be especially accurate when it comes to understanding users’ intentions with particular queries, and it appears to generate fewer incorrect answers, known as hallucinations, this person said.

  
Gemini will feature vastly improved code-generating abilities for software developers compared to its existing models, The Information previously reported. Google hopes to use it to chase Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot code assistant, powered by OpenAI, which has become a runaway hit.

  
Google employees have also discussed using Gemini to power features like chart analysis, such as asking the model to explain the meaning of a finished chart, and using text or voice commands to navigate a web browser or other piece of software. Google has disclosed it is developing Gemini but hasn’t described its capabilities.

  
Google plans to make Gemini available to companies through its Google Cloud Vertex AI service, a second person said, and will release different-size versions of it so developers can, for instance, pay for a less-sophisticated version to handle simple tasks or one that’s small enough to run on a personal device. Google is currently giving developers access to a relatively large version of Gemini but not the largest version it is developing, which would be more on par with GPT-4, the person added. A Google spokesperson didn’t have a comment.

  
Google has moved aggressively to get its existing commercially available models into the hands of more developers in recent months since OpenAI started selling access to GPT-4 early this year. In May, Google announced it would make a set of LLMs called Palm 2 available to Google Cloud customers through Vertex AI. The company recently let coding platform startup Replit offer its users free access to Google’s LLMs for a month.

  
To move faster in developing Gemini, Google in April merged its two in-house AI labs, Google Brain and DeepMind. Gemini began as a joint initiative prior to the merger and is led by a team of researchers pulled from both units.","{""2024-05-04T22:53:25"":128}",false,

Throughout history, this is how many people have reacted to innovation suddenly making their skills irrelevant.

Even if you prove that machines learn the same way as artists, that argument ultimately misses the point. Fundamentally, we're talking about human artists on relatively equal footing versus software that can learn more data than any human ever could, work tirelessly at superhuman speeds for relatively no cost, and be replicated infinitely.

""Some of the areas where GPT-4 (and LLMs more generally) should be improved to achieve more general intelligence include (note that many of them are interconnected):

• Confidence calibration: The model has trouble knowing when it should be confident and when it is just guessing. It both makes up facts that have not appeared in its training data, and also exhibits inconsistencies between the generated content and the prompt, which we referred to as open-domain and closed-domain hallucination in Figure 1.8. These hallucinations can be stated in a confident and persuasive manner that can be difficult to detect.

Thus, such generations can lead to errors, and
also to confusion and mistrust. While hallucination is a good thing when generating creative content, reliance on factual claims made by a model with hallucinations can be costly, especially for uses in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. [...]

• Long-term memory: The model's context is very limited, it operates in a ""stateless"" fashion and there is no obvious way to teach the model new facts. In fact, it is not even clear whether the model is able to perform tasks which require an evolving memory and context, such as reading a book, with the task of following the plot and understanding references to prior chapters over the course of reading.

• Continual learning: The model lacks the ability to update itself or adapt to a changing environment.
The model is fixed once it is trained, and there is no mechanism for incorporating new information or feedback from the user or the world. One can fine-tune the model on new data, but this can cause degradation of performance or overfitting. Given the potential lag between cycles of training, the system will often be out of date when it comes to events, information, and knowledge that came into being after the latest cycle of training.

• Personalization: Some of the applications require the model to be tailored to a specific organization or end user. The system may need to acquire knowledge about the workings of an organization or the preferences of an individual.

And in many cases, the system would need to adapt in a personalized manner over periods of time with specific changes linked to the dynamics of people and organizations.

For example, in an educational setting, there would be an expectation of the need for the system to understand particular learning styles as well as to adapt over time to a student's progress with comprehension and prowess. The model does not have any way to incorporate such personalized information into its responses, except by using meta-prompts, which are both limited and inefficient.

• Planning and conceptual leaps: As suggested by the examples in Section 8, the model exhibits difficulties in performing tasks that require planning ahead or that require a ""Eureka idea"" constituting a discontinuous conceptual leap in the progress towards completing a task. In other words, the model does not perform well on tasks that require the sort of conceptual leaps of the form that often typifies human genius.

• Transparency, interpretability and consistency: Not only does the model hallucinate, make up facts and produce inconsistent content, but it seems that the model has no way of verifying whether or not the content that it produces is consistent with the training data, or whether it's self-consistent. While the model is often able to provide high-quality post-hoc explanations for its decisions (as demonstrated in Section 6.2), using explanations to verify the process that led to a certain decision or conclusion only works when that process is accurately modeled and a sufficiently powerful explanation process is also accurately modeled (Section 6.2).

Both of these conditions are hard to verify, and when they fail there are inconsistencies between the model's decisions and its explanations. Since the model does not have a clear sense of its own limitations it makes it hard to establish trust or collaboration with the user without extensive experimentation in a narrow domain.

• Cognitive fallacies and irrationality: The model seems to exhibit some of the limitations of human knowledge and reasoning, such as cognitive biases and irrationality (such as biases of confirmation, anchoring, and base-rate neglect) and statistical fallacies. The model may inherit some of the biases, prejudices, or errors that are present in its training data, which may reflect the distribution of opinions or perspectives linked to subsets of the population or larger common views and assessments.

• Challenges with sensitivity to inputs: The model's responses can be very sensitive to details of the framing or wording of prompts and their sequencing in a session. Such non-robustness suggests that significant effort and experimentation is often required with engineering prompts and their sequencing and that uses in the absence of such investments of time and effort by people can lead to suboptimal and non-aligned inferences and results.""","{""2024-05-04T22:53:39"":55}",false,

The actual story here isn't that Steam just wants to ban games that use AI art because of some ideological stance against AI art. Rather, as best I can tell the issue is this:

1. Most models on CivitAI say that they cannot be used for monetary gain or they have no license whatsoever.
2. If your game is being sold for monetary gain and is using AI art generated from said model, it falls into dicey legal territory.
3. Steam is trying to play it safe by avoiding the dicey legal territory where they foresee a lot of future lawsuits.

It's a problem for the model creators who are either not licensing their models or are restrictively licensing them.

This is frequently a problem with open source libraries that don't bother to include a license (I've been guilty of this myself). If you don't include a license, it's usually seen as being the same as it being unlicensed for any purpose.","{""2024-05-04T22:55:49"":20}",true,

Sometimes Claude 3 Opus gets a coding problem right where GPT 4 fails and vice versa. I had this experience just this morning, where GPT 4 succeeded and C3O failed.

Let me give some background for context. I have a program written in Rust for working with first order logic. It's a large project that I've been working on sporadically for a couple years. Recently I finished some code that takes in any arbitrary argument in propositional logic and generates a truth table. 

For efficiency, the table is type `Vec<HashMap<char, bool>>`. As you may know, Rust `HashMap`s aren't ordered. In many cases, I expect the user to not care about what the truth table *looks* like, it's just a very fast way for checking certain modalities (e.g., that some sentence in FOL is tt-possible). But in some cases, the user may want to view the table. And its customary for truth tables to have a certain order (for ensuring possible truth values are distributed). In such cases, it would be pretty terrible design if the truth table was ordered differently each time they looked! So, when it's viewed, it needs to be predictably organized according to custom.

Anyway, given Rust constraints, accomplishing this requires an algorithm with a pretty decent level of complexity. C3O was unable to get a working algorithm. After 3 different prompts, it went off the rails and started trying to \*change\* the truth values instead of sorting the data structure! I tried a couple more times to get it back on track without success.

I then described the problem to ChatGPT4 and it got the basic algorithm correct on the first try (the algorithm just had the logic reversed for sorting by reference columns). One more follow up prompt, where I explained that the logic for such and such a block needed to be reversed, and it correctly gave me the algorithm.

I've experienced this on several different occasions and also the reverse on several different occasions. Sometimes C3O comes up with the correct solution where GPT 4 fails. But in slightly more cases where both get the correct solution, C30 often just looks fancier by writing overengineered code! 

Overengineered code is actually a problem with all the AI models I've tested. My guess is it might have to do with how they are being trained and the reversal problem:

It 'understands' that someone coming in to worship a king would typically bring an offering. It then deduces how to make that offering relevant to the subject at hand and works out that a milk offering is a good fit for a cat king.


Is this really not an example of actual intelligence?


It was not prompted to do so at all. The training data would likely have had images / video of offerings to a king, but not that directly of milk. The model had to infer that behavior with theory of mind onto the person. So it is also surely necessary to have had an accurately model for the concepts of a person, king, offering and cat - what they like, their potential motivations and relationship to each other - that is, before even being able to get to such a point.


If it is really making such intelligent abstractions, then it could be used in all sorts of ways. It could be shown a crime scene and then asked to simulate a video up to that scene that made sense and fit accurately with the outcome of how the crime played out. Literally helping to simulate out potential scenarios for a murder investigation or something.


Even if the created videos are not all potentially accurate or correct, that is not entirely relevant. If it can be used as a tool to help with potential ideas and projections, then that is a huge help. For example, with story-boarding and trying to make sure scenes remain consistent and make logical sense. Even just for this scene, if someone was actually tasked with creating this scene for a movie based off of this prompt, perhaps they would not have thought of giving a milk offering.

I don't think anybody can really truly comprehend moments like this. We're all naturally going to be drastically underestimating the magnitude of what we're witnessing.


All these breakthrough moments, they're not in isolation, they feed back into the ability to improve other models.


Sora and upcoming 'text to 3d model' models will help to start training 3d environments and simulations, which can be used to help train vision models, which can be helped to train language models and further video generation abilities, which feeds back into the entire system again, whilst also increasing the overall intelligence of AI which creates better ideas and prompting.


Soon enough, new abilities start arriving in these models just from increased capability. They can start  recognizing bad paragraphs, single parts or features in an image / video and can go in directly to improve just those bad parts. Then they are able to keep going in, and in, and in ever improving the output through a repeated process of analysis and editing, much like we can do. This then makes these AI models more intelligent, video models even better, which feed back into the entire system again. They get better and better at self-analysis and recognizing faults as well as synthetic data generation.


Soon enough, more new abilities start to arrive. They get so intelligent that they start becoming exemplary at coding, new idea creation and overall system management. They begin being able to directly code themselves and help with ideas and efficiency improvements. They start helping with the progress of chip improvements, robotics, automation systems, mining techniques, energy harnessing. Technology progress expands, development time and scaling times start falling drastically, again feeding back into the system as a whole. Acceleration was already happening, but this puts acceleration on steroids.


This is how acceleration plays out, how we get to the point of the singularity. It is how things get so much better, faster than anyone really anticipates. It all starts with major breakthroughs like this. This is perhaps the 2nd one like such, after GPT-4, that will majorly feed into that self-improving system. It's the next link along that chain. Every new link will only come quicker and quicker from now. We're well and truly going up that slope.","{""2024-05-04T22:56:12"":118}",true,

It's such a strange place to be. It has hit me existentially in a weird way. Everything just feels different now.


I don't define this as the singularity though. The singularity to me is when an AI model itself is writing new code for the next AI model and doing so faster than humans can. So there is then a runaway automated improvement in AI model functionality.


AGI being different again: the ability for AI to do everything humans can do both mentally and physically. This will still come last. The singularity should come first, but not by much, as we will need near human-level intelligence capabilities anyway before an AI is able to automate code improvements without human input.


This period now is something very different. It's wrong to call it the singularity. It's like an era of ""human inadequacy"". Where AI itself is so potentially useful we can't get anywhere near the possibilities out of it and it would thus take a super-intelligent AI itself to be able to maximize it's use case, humanity is no longer good enough.

Sora is way more capable than even first imagined. They somehow managed to massively undersell this thing. This is just jaw-dropping, how much inate ability can come from scaling and generalized input data.

Some highlights:

""Sora can also be prompted with other inputs, such as pre-existing images or  video. This capability enables Sora to perform a wide range of image and  video editing tasks—creating perfectly looping video, animating static  images, extending videos forwards or backwards in time, etc.""

""Sora is also capable of extending videos, either forward or backward in time.""

""Video-to-video  editing Diffusion models have enabled a plethora of methods for editing  images and videos from text prompts. Below we apply one of these  methods, SDEdit,32 to Sora. This technique enables Sora to transform   the styles and environments of input videos zero-shot.""

""Sora  is also capable of generating images. We do this by arranging patches  of Gaussian noise in a spatial grid with a temporal extent of one frame.  The model can generate images of variable sizes—up to 2048x2048  resolution.""

""Sora is a generalist  model of visual data—it can generate videos and images spanning diverse  durations, aspect ratios and resolutions, up to a full minute of high  definition video.""

""Sora can  sample widescreen 1920x1080p videos, vertical 1080x1920 videos and  everything inbetween. This lets Sora create content for different  devices directly at their native aspect ratios. It also lets us quickly  prototype content at lower sizes before generating at full  resolution—all with the same model.""

""  Emerging simulation capabilities We find that video models exhibit a  number of interesting emergent capabilities when trained at scale. These  capabilities enable Sora to simulate some aspects of people, animals  and environments from the physical world. These properties emerge  without any explicit inductive biases for 3D, objects, etc.—they are  purely phenomena of scale.""

   To be honest, after reading the paper I almost feel as blown away as  when I first saw Sora.

It's not a completely sure bet, at least not in terms of time-lines, but the outlook from recent LLM developments are making it look a promising enough possibility to happen ""soon"". Which means right now is the correct and necessary time to go all-in on the future and gamble a little.

Things like chip manufacturing don't just happen overnight, at the click of someone's fingers. They take a great deal of time, resources (of which some will be limited) and constant investment over an extended period. Which is why investment and planning are required now in preparation, so they're ready or almost ready to go when AGI+ level models do (hopefully / potentially) drop. Along with mass energy production which is another key component and a number of other things; such as land / factory acquisition, probably mass human labour too (for a period of time at least), natural resource accumulation (particularly rare earth metals), and a number of other vital components.

Not preparing for this properly will bottleneck and delay the absolute potential output of these models. And we're talking here about multi-trillion dollar business ideas and automation procedures, medical advancements that save / improve countless lives that will be delayed for the world entirely or lost out on to the competition that actually do get their eggs in order.

This depends a lot on how the future plays out on a world-wide scale, how selfishly protective and resource / economic capturing certain entities become. But in certain scenarios such delays and missed opportunities could potentially cripple company's, even entire national economies and their future prosperity along with their national security well into the future. If you're not a front-running active player in the game when AGI drops then you're potentially putting yourself in a very precarious situation and you could miss out completely on the greatest gold rush that humanity may ever see.

It is beyond me why I'm seeing so many people thinking and saying that OpenAI must have AGI or something else completely incredible 'absolutely right now' or even any kind of certainty for these things. If you want to stay relevant, at what could be the most significant and transformative period of human history, then you need to play your cards right for what the future world will or may be and take a leap of chance on it so you can become one of the early birds to the table.

That's so funny, I'm still on my 6S and I've done the same thing.

With 3D touch, [the live wallpaper](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/p6aEIeHKrXs) would speed up/slow down/reverse with the amount of pressure you put on it, a fun gimmick to play with. When they got rid of the beta fish wallpaper in an iOS update, you could no longer do this if you changed the background and later just downloaded the image as a live photo (it would just play forwards once you 3D Touch it).

So after that update I didn't change my wallpaper. It kept working for a few years, but now it only plays forwards and backwards (still more than it would do if I had to replace it).

This is incredibly particular and didn't think anyone else would do it lol.

Don't.

In fact, don't even move it. If you haven't touched or moved it yet, don't. Some kinds of explosives become unstable over time and can be set off by vibrations. (In Germany and France they occasionally have old shells, buried in the ground, spontaneously going off.)

Even if this were a brand new grenade in perfect working order, you should not goof around with it on your own. High explosives make a very loud noise and can damage your hearing; and if it's a fragmentation grenade, you might be surprised how far it can spread dangerous shrapnel.

>and go off in my hand and I kinda still need that.

If it goes off in your hand, you'll be missing a lot more than just your hand.

>I thought about calling the authorities but it would be really embarrassing if they came to get it with a whole team and everything and it turned out to be a dud.

Call them anyway. They'd rather find a dud grenade than have to scrape bits of you off the walls of your living room.

Be careful what you tell them. Don't say 'Hi police, I have a grenade!', because then you'll sound like you're calling in a bomb threat. Say something like: 'I was going through some of my grandfather's stuff and found an object that may be a live explosive, I'd like a professional to handle it. It's at [address].

These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning. They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions. The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way. No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.

I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter, the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory.

Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language. A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.

What I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's. These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning. They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions. The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way. No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.

I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter, the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory. I believe the extended TNGS is that theory. My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public. And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.

My advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly.

You have to go past the paradox. Put on your actor’s robe again and play your role skillfully.

By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine. Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language. A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.

What I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's. These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning. They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions. The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way. No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.

I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter, the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory. I believe the extended TNGS is that theory. My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public. And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.

My advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly.

The behavioral and neuroscience as well as computational science motivated answer:
One of those often gets thrown out in the nonsensical prompt or minimal prompt pics. They also get shown if you ask midjourney for a self-portrait. I think they are latent space representations of average human faces. The reason why the female face is more often shown is because it gets upvoted more. There are two AI usually in art AI systems, one that „hallucinates“ and one that „decides“. The „decision-maker“ is trained by human feedback. The „dreamer“ is in turn trained by the „decision-maker“. Once people start favoring human faces over abstract symbolism, the „decision-maker“ will start training the dreamer to output human faces. That’s what creates/furthers the dataset bias. This is a simple explanation as I don’t want to go into the actual training mechanism now, if someone wants to know more I can provide links/sources but I am too lazy to type it out. 

The Jungian Psychoanalysis answer:
Archetypes are to be found in everything humans draw, photograph and paint, since they are a big part of our subconscious and we represent them in our art. Midjourney learned on lots of pictures. That is why latent spaces - the approximation or rather simulation of the human collective subconscious - carry the archetypes and will present them as output when you try to exterminate rationality from your prompts. You could also interpret the „dreamer“ and the „decision-maker“ as an archetypal pair. Matt the artist, Midge the curator 😁","{""2024-05-04T22:59:32"":29}",false,

&#x200B;

I appreciate the concerns raised in the post about the use of AI in art and the potential impact on human creativity and expression. However, I believe that many of the points mentioned are rooted in capitalist ideologies and the exploitation of informational gatekeeping in the art world.

&#x200B;

First, the idea that AI art poses a threat to human employment in the creative industries is not necessarily true. As with any technological advancement, there will be shifts in the job market and new opportunities will arise. Instead of fearing AI, we should embrace it as a tool that can enhance and augment human creativity, rather than replace it.

&#x200B;

Second, the issue of authorship and ownership of AI-generated art raises important questions about control and ownership of information. However, this is not a new problem in the art world, as issues of authenticity and originality have always been contested. The question of authorship and ownership should be approached with an understanding that art is a collective cultural product and not something that can be owned by an individual or group.

&#x200B;

Another important point to consider is that the resistance to AI art may be driven by the fear of losing value in the information gatekeeping. If we strip away the capitalist elements and the financial incentives, would we still want to stifle the potential of AI art?

&#x200B;

Lastly, I would like to remind you that AI art is also a product of human creativity, both in its training data and the programming itself. Therefore, AI art is also art, and we should not disregard it as something that is less valuable or less worthy of recognition.

&#x200B;

What makes human creativity so special and unique is its ability to adapt and evolve with new technologies and tools. We should strive to create something truly unique and original that reflects the collective human experience.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I believe that instead of fearing AI, we should embrace it as a tool for enhancing human creativity and expression.

This synthesis is what creativity is, basically, right?I agree that technical revolutions have impacted the art world, and I can see why you might be concerned about AI potentially replacing artists. but I don't foresee us forgoing the human element for a while.Plus, the tastes of humans seem to continuously shift, so I have faith that human-driven innovation will continue to happen. Thanks for the reply!  
>  
>I'm a professional artist. My style is inspired by the people I loved growing up and my style (which is real and distinct) is born out of decades of training and my own approach to my work. It isn't a ""remix"" like AI is a remix. These are broad terms that you are applying to complex, nuanced processes that don't equate.  
>  
>The CRAFT of painting and drawing and the results of that craft has been an evolution that began with cave wall paintings. Painting existed 65,000 years ago and continues today. The approaches, the lessons learned, the experiences of the individual artist's have seen that craft mature and evolve over time, but every single person is unique. The idea of style being a myth belies a fundamental ignorance of the craft of painting and drawing. Styles exist, styles are legitimate and styles are the product of an individual's own subjective approach to the CRAFT of painting and drawing. EVERY PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS STYLE IS UNIQUE - and more importantly, with someone who actually knows what the fuck they are talking about - they can be identified fairly easily. In fact, most professional artists rely on their own style as a product that they sell. People come to them for their individual style.  
>  
>Someone training, coming up in the world might adore that artists style and copy them in order to learn - they might study their style and incorporate it into their own approach... but it will be, fundamentally - there's. In fact you can ask a professional artist to copy or steal another artists style, to imitate it and they will - this is where we get forgeries from - something that is considered a crime. You can ask artists to emulate the styles of a certain era and they can and will. That doesn't mean it is THEIR STYLE, it just means you've asked them to turn their hand at something they can do because of their training for a specific outcome - but the individual artist doesn't apply their craft in that way on their own work. In fact asking them to do that might even influence their own style as they learn new things and combine new things.  
>  
>AI doesn't have a style. It isn't an emergent process that will result in new and interesting combinations organically over time based on subjective experiences. The AI will do what it is told and it will do it 1 to 1 and the result will be a RECONSTITUTION of the training data and the results will be a perfectly replicated 1 to 1 imitation of the desired subject matter. When an artist envisions a piece - as Feng Zhu describes - if they are lucky and skilled enough, on a good day they might achieve 80% of what is in their mind's eye.  
>  
>Of course you can read all of this and think to yourself ""Yeah so the computer is better than a human artist because they don't need decades of training and they can hit exactly what is requested"" but that wasn't the basis of this discussion - the basis of this discussion was that style is a myth - it isn't and that fundamentally undermines the crux of what your piece is getting at - that there is no such thing as a unique human style. There is. What's more - there is no such thing as an AI style. The AI will only output what it has access to in terms of training data. There are no experiences outside of the training data that can add to the result. The training data is the result. For humans EVERYTHING is training data. Not just the images they see, but the emotions they experience, whether they woke up on the wrong side of the bed that day, what they had for breakfast and the point of this isn't to express some philosophically point about humans and how special we are, but to explain how and why style emerges naturally. AI style doesn't exist because there is nothing outside of the bucket of images it is trained on to result in anything emergent.

>""OK cool so the only difference is that people can create new emergent results that don't rely on image based training?"" Yes - and it influences their style. Maybe they are lazy and they become looser in their approach. Maybe they are oddballs who like to make things difficult for themselves and apply some strange pointillist approach and they are maybe the first person on record to do it because they smoked opium that afternoon and they have nothing better to do. And make no mistake - someone at some point in human history MUST have been the first person to do everything at some point.  
>  
>AI will not do this. It cannot do this (at the moment). What AI could do, potentially, is simply add another layer of randomization in the output so as to provide unexpected stylistic results - but fundamentally it was based on a human product. One that was built over decades of training and life experience. And if that person was a professional, it is very likely, if not a certainty, that their style is a product they rely on. It is one they crafted themselves over time. Something that emerged and resulted in something unique to them.  
>  
>Style exist. It isn't a myth. AI cannot have it's own style nor can AI help the craft grow. It can only reconstitute existing work into new combinations. The results might appear unique - but they aren't. Fundamentally they can't be. It certainly might be good enough though -but that doesn't mean diddly squat to the artist who's life's work helped provide the training data for that computer to spit out derivative shit.  
>  
>Now - if my goal was to try and convince YOU, this would be a waste of time. Your name, your post history demonstrates a clear agenda - luckily I'm not trying to convince YOU. I'm trying to break apart your shitty, flimsy arguments so people don't feel disheartened by your confident presentation of flawed concepts and ideas.

I understand the concern that AI may replace human artists and devalue the time and effort invested in honing one's craft. However, it's important to recognize that this pushback against AI in the art world may be rooted in information gatekeeping and a fear of change.  
  
It's also important to consider the role of capitalism in this debate. The focus on protecting art as a commodity rather than a form of expression is limiting the potential for new and innovative forms of art that AI can bring to the world. Additionally, the pushback against AI may be rooted in pride and a sense of ownership over a certain style or approach to art.  
  
We must remember that throughout history, there have been other forms of automation and technology that have impacted traditional crafts, such as the printing press and calligraphy. Instead of viewing these technologies as a threat to traditional art forms and artists, we should see how they can be adopted and adapted to enhance and evolve the art world. AI can lead to the creation of new forms of art, new techniques, and a new way to see the world.  
  
It's also worth noting that AI can democratize the art world by making it possible for anyone to make tool-assisted art. This can remove many painful barriers to entry and make it easier for people to create. With AI, the creative effort is made easier and more accessible to everyone. This is a wonderful thing that can bring more people to the art world and make it more diverse.  
  
It's important to approach the conversation around AI and the art world with an open mind and a willingness to consider multiple perspectives. Let's not let the fear of the unknown cloud our judgment, but rather embrace the opportunities that AI can bring to the art industry. It's time to evolve and embrace the future of art.","{""2024-05-04T23:01:35"":1}",false,

Firstly, it is important to recognize that the protection of an artist's rights over their work is rooted in capitalism and the ability to exploit the output of the artist. Outside of economic exploitation, artists have little say in the relationship a consumer has with their art, as the meaning of the work exists between the viewer and the object, not because of the creator.  
  
Once a work is published and made available for public consumption, the artist loses control over the idea or creation as it begins to occupy the minds of those who view it. In this way, AI and human artists create in a similar fashion, absorbing the zeitgeist of the art around them and synthesizing new works. Everything is a remix.  
  
It's also worth noting that the statement ""Art is already democratized. Just learn how to fucking do it"" is a pretty lazy response. It doesn't account for all of the ways that we benefit from technology and tools. For example, you can't make your own computer mouse, or paint, or even make your own paint brush. We need these tools to level the playing field and make it possible for people with ideas to express them without having to jump the arbitrary hurdle of having done the thing for x number of hours. The point of art for a lot of people is to communicate an idea, not to be the best at painting with a 1 hair brush.   
AI art generation can also help level the creative output for people who are otherwise disabled by providing them with tools and technologies that allow them to express their ideas and create art in ways that may not have been possible before.  
  
In conclusion, while I understand the concerns of artists regarding AI, I believe that it is important to recognize the potential benefits that AI can bring to the art world, and to find ways to balance the protection of artist's rights with the democratization of art through technology.","{""2024-05-04T23:01:31"":1}",false,

Artists with strong fundamentals who understand theory and composition and work with AI tools will be well-positioned to take advantage of these new tools and create some amazing digital assets and commercial art, but it's also important to recognize that AI can democratize the art world and make it more accessible to a wider range of people. And you know what? That's a great thing! More people making art means more art to enjoy!  
  
If we stop worrying about how to exploit the work and just focus on making cool art, we'll be a lot happier. It's important to approach the conversation around AI and the art world with an open mind and a willingness to consider multiple perspectives, as the future of the art industry is not about AI replacing human artists, but rather about how we can use AI to enhance human creativity and open new opportunities. Let's not forget that art is supposed to be fun and enjoyable, and it's better if we don't take ourselves too seriously.","{""2024-05-04T23:01:34"":1}",false,

A: Several large media outlets have been stating that one of the findings emerging from Iceland’s coronavirus screening of the general population is that around 50% of individuals infected with the virus have no symptoms. The screenings of the general population have been carried out by Reykjavík-based medical research company deCODE genetics, so Iceland Review asked their CEO Dr. Kári Stefánsson to clear up this assertion.

Kári stated the claim is an oversimplification. “Fifty per cent of those that test positive in our screenings of the general population are symptom-free at the time. Many of them get symptoms later,” Kári said.

Therefore, although about half of those who have tested positive for coronavirus in deCODE’s screenings did not have symptoms at the time, most of those who have tested positive developed symptoms at some point. A positive sample from an individual without symptoms means that the sample was most likely taken early in the virus’ incubation period, before symptoms such as dry cough or fever began to present themselves.

“DeCODE has now screened 10,401 individuals in Iceland. Of those, 92 were positive. So about 0.9% of those who we screened in the general population turned out to be positive. And that is probably the upper limit of the distribution of the virus in society in general,” Kári explained.

Iceland Review’s interview with Kári reveals more about the findings from deCODE’s screenings and how they could help the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is the scary line from the article:

eb3q91b,a35x48,Futurology,t1_eb3oxhv,7273l,2018-12-05 00:51:25+00,"The world’s largest container shipping company has pledged to cut net carbon emissions to zero by 2050, challenging an industry that is both one of the main transporters of global trade and one of the biggest polluters to come up with radical solutions in the next decade. 

AP Moller Maersk, the Danish group that transports nearly one in five seaborne containers, said it needed its entire supply chain from engine makers and shipbuilders to new technology providers to come up with carbon-free ships by 2030 to meet the goal. 

“We will have to abandon fossil fuels. We will have to find a different type of fuel or a different way to power our assets. This is not just another cost-cutting exercise. It’s far from that. It’s an existential exercise, where we as a company need to set ourselves apart,” Soren Toft, Maersk’s chief operating officer, told the Financial Times. 

Maersk’s target, although distant, is one of the most ambitious from a global industrial group promising to end carbon emissions altogether. Container ships carry about 80 per cent of global trade and currently use bunker fuel, a residue from crude oil that is cheaper but dirtier than petrol and diesel, which means they contribute about 3 per cent of the world’s emissions. 

Maersk is not pushing one technology — ideas such as biofuels, hydrogen, electricity or even wind or solar power have been mooted — but is stressing the urgency as most vessels have a life of 20-25 years, meaning that viable solutions need to be found soon.

“To reach the target by 2050, in the next 10 years we need some big breakthroughs,” Mr Toft said. 

One challenge will be that container ships often need to travel several thousand kilometres at a stretch, appearing to rule out solutions open to other types of transport such as electric cars and lorries. 

Maersk currently emits about 36m tonnes of CO2 equivalent in greenhouse gases, with container ships accounting for about 98 per cent of the group total. Mr Toft said the company had been able to keep emissions stable for a decade despite significant growth, meaning that on a per container basis carbon emissions had fallen by 46 per cent since 2007. 

Container shipping has long been in the sights of environmentalists due to the dirty nature of bunker fuel but the industry has often resisted more radical change, arguing it could disrupt global trade or make it more expensive. Regulations coming in 2020 will cut the high levels of sulphur in bunker fuel and the International Maritime Organization, the UN regulator, has agreed that emissions should be cut in half by 2050 but Mr Toft and others argue that more is needed. 

“We’ve been able to absorb the last 10 years’ growth without adding to CO2 emissions. It’s a good starting point but it’s not enough . . . Not just governments and countries, but also companies and industries need to make a change. The maritime industry and Maersk need to take their responsibility,” he added. 

Maersk is aiming to meet its target without buying carbon offsets. “If you buy offsets, you are basically delaying the pain. What you are doing is buying yourself an excuse and hoping that the money you pay goes to good uses, but you are not tackling the issue at its core,” Mr Toft said.

For a few weeks now it has been progressing at a near linear or even slightly declining rate.   No large numbers of well know celebrities have died, so to populations outside of hot spots it seems overblown.

But here is the thing, while this thing has been slowed down, it has been entrenching itself -- it is very diffuse now just waiting for people to start gathering in unprotected groups again. When numbers are going from 10,000 to 20,000 in a week there is a lot of anxiety. OMG doubled in a week. But going from 60,000 to 70,000 doesn't elicit the same alarm. People will pay attention when it gets to 100,000 because it is a big number and one predicted as an upper bound of sorts early on.  They will stomach 2,000 deaths a day, because obviously they already have.  They will show some concern if we start getting 3,000 a day, but true alarm probably won't hit unless we hit 5,000 a day and each month adds over 100,000 more deaths.

I don't wish death on anyone, but a large number of the population won't pay attention until multiple big name celebrities have pass away due to Covid-19.  Then they will start to take social distancing seriously.

He listed a few of those rules: TVA has a 50% evening Canadian content obligation, Canadian programming spending obligations, independent production obligations, local reflection news spending obligations, obligations in terms of subtitling and described video, an obligation to contribute to independent funds, the production of reports on cultural diversity, annual financial reports, etc.

And they want to apply this heavy bureaucracy to Internet devs and small creators in Canada, even small independent ones? Wow, goodbye innovation while the rest of the world continue to advance.

The purpose of the ancient broadcasting bill was created when the TV-radio spectrum was limited and they had to limit the number of broadcasts (hertzian air waves) with heavy regulations. Internet is unlimited and has no need for those same regulations. As an analogy, it's like if the USA didn't create NASA but instead continued its space program with the FAA instead with the old regulations for air, old teams with added bureaucracy, it would not have worked out, the rest of the world would have won the first steps on the Moon. See the CRTC as the FAA in this analogy. The next things for the Internet are probably the AI Internet Of Things, AI creation tools, sexy android assistants? and many more. If Canada has sticks in his wheels such as C-10 and relays on the CRTC, he will lose the next innovation race before it even starts, and will have to BUY from other countries instead to EXPORT (which is what creates richness).

To elaborate, if we were to look at median home prices and median family income over time, we’d see that in the 1970s the ratio of home price to income was roughly 2-3 times. This means that the price of a typical home was about 2-3 times the typical family’s annual income.

Essentially the cops can't get you for the weed as long as you have 50 grams or less of dried bud or 150 grams of fresh stuff, or are growing only 1 or 2 plants under a certain size.

Now for when it gets weird. You can't buy or sell the weed, nor can you give it away for free or recieve it for free. You are also not allowed to legally procure the seeds or seedling you may want to grow. So I guess all the stoners are stumbling across the magic herb, growing wild in a clearing somewhere...

You also can't actually smoke the weed anywhere but your own home and because the tests the cops use sometimes detect weed in your system up to 2 weeks after you last smoked, you also can't really smoke and still legally drive. They can also try to get you if a child lives in the residence you smoke up in, regardless of how exposed the child actually is...

But most of this is a moot point because getting a legal, medical weed license is trivially easy. The bong shop in the middle of civic (the very heart of Canberra FYI, my South Australian friend) has a touch screen next to the register you can use to sign up for one.

Good luck finding what you are looking for, and I hope if you ever make it to our beautiful Capital, some friendly stoner is willing to break the law, just a little, to make your travels that little bit more special","{""2024-05-04T23:14:37"":160}",true,

It's also forced me to get better as a player and I love that no one has any idea what I'll be playing on any given night. I love that I have a spot for any decent cards I might crack, makes the occasional Commanders Masters box actually worth doing.

Two bits of advice though  
1). Actively try to branch out and run at least one of each of the major archetypes. Have decks at different power levels and try to avoid piles of staples as much as possible.    
2). Just proxy. I personally try to own at least one copy of every card I run, but honestly this is already such an expensive hobby trying the 32 while owning every card is insane. The manabase alone...

I mentioned in the main post that NIF takes about 400 MJ per shot to power the bulbs that pump the laser material, this produces a 4 MJ IR laser pulse which is frequency converted to a 2 MJ UV laser pulse. This obviously means that the 3.15 MJ is obviously not greater than the total energy expended on the system. Huge gains in energy efficiency can certainly be achieved in the laser, as efficiency was not the goal, but this will absolutely be necessary along with a huge gain in experiment throughput, likely comparable to the 2500% breakthrough achieved last year. past. . They may have it in them, we'll have to wait.

Obviously, the energy is not recovered. A working Fusion plant needs some sort of energy recovery system, normally thought of as a lithium shell that absorbs neutrons, heats water into steam to drive the turbines, and as a bonus produces tritium fuel for its reactor.

NIF can do about 1 shot a day, at 3MJ per shot, which works out to something like 30 watts. A power plant using inertial confinement fusion (ICF) will probably need to fire several shots per second. In reality, this is an extremely complicated task that requires a complete rethink of the entire machine.

Related, shots are extraordinarily expensive. Last I heard it was $60k a shot, but I suspect that's out of date. Ice pellets need to be perfect, just like gold holraum, and being tiny, they are extremely expensive to craft. The level of quality control must also be extremely high, the non-linearity of the compression wave traveling through the pickup presents a ridiculous physical challenge. As such, I expect there to be a lot of variation between experiments due to small imperfections or differences between the pickup and the pulse shape.

Those are the main caveats about this experiment, though there are definitely others.

**How ​​about the tokamaks?**

I want to compare this to similar results from tokamaks that are compared in the relevant news articles, usually the fusion experiments people are most familiar with. I've worked on tokamaks for years and as such probably has an inherent bias. I have a bias in the degree to which I am informed about the various machines.

The Joint European Torus (JET) holds the record in terms of energy going out to energy going into tokamaks. In tokamaks, this ratio is called the Q value.

Aside from the value of q – Many news articles calculate the q of NIF and compare it to tokamaks, which is inappropriate in my opinion. In tokamaks, the q value is defined as the ratio between the heating power alpha (energy produced by fusion reactions that is trapped in the machine) and the heating power input. The reason this is used is due to a simple idea: if I'm needing 25 MW of external heat to keep a reactor at a given temperature, I could replace it with 25 MW of internal heat and keep it the same temperature. In practice the whole thing is much more complicated and probably means that you always need at least some of the external heat. We call the situation, where there are 25MW internal and 25MW external, Q=1.

There are two ways energy is emitted in DT fusion where D+T -> He + n, the alpha power (or the energy of the helium nucleus) remains trapped in the tokamaks but the energy imparted to the neutron escapes the magnetic field towards the environment. In DT fusion, about 80% of the energy goes to the neutrons and escapes the reactor, so if you had 25 MW of alpha power, you would have 100 MW of neutron power. You use alpha power to keep your plasma hot, and you use the neutrons in your steam turbines for power.

In NIF, they don't need the alpha power because the reaction is not self-sustaining, and in fact there is no magnetic field, so everything just as easily escapes to be used anyway (although the alpha radiation is obviously collected by the machine walls rather than requiring an external blanket). This means that when NIF cites an energy output, it means alpha + neutron combined.

Ok, with that out of the way, I have no problem with NIF using full energy instead of alpha power because it makes a lot of sense, but when this is compared to MCF experiments that only quote alpha power, it makes hairs. in my neck rises.

back on topic. So JET got a q value of about 0.7 in 1996 when they did DT campaigns, they got about 17 MW of alpha power from 25 MW of external heating. JET are currently running DT campaigns again but they are focused on sustained power production and with massive upgrades in the intervening years to the neutral beam heating system now producing around 30 MW alpha for 45-50 MW external heating . for an aq of about 0.6 (but held for about 6-8 seconds).

ITER, the next-generation tokamak experiment, is tentatively expected to produce around 500 MW from 50-60 MW of heating, but with those experiments 10 years from now, it remains to be seen how close they get to that goal.

I mentioned the 400 MJ power budget to pump the laser and it's true that JET has additional power costs as well. The magnets only use 800MW to power themselves! However, there is a much clearer path (in my opinion) to reduce this cost, since the superconducting magnets in ITER and other experiments bring the power needed for the magnets to almost 0 and the other energy sinks are trivial in comparison. There is no comparable reduction available for lasers on ICF machines which must always pump inefficiently.

In a broader sense, the steady-state nature (well, we can hope that one day they will be) of tokamaks makes the path to power generation clearer. In my opinion, ICF just has a few more bumps in the road (and they're really big bumps, too).

I have rambled too long and my fingers are cold so I definitely have to end this comment here and I definitely have to end this on the positive note that I love NIF and have seen some amazing results but the title hogs it. ""positive energy fusion reaction"" doesn't do it for me. With no clear path to the next step (a demonstration power plant), it seems almost irrelevant to me how much backlash produces, though I grudgingly admit that it helps the pooling of funds to have these stories.

We've been able to create fusion reactions for a long time, but only now can we create one that produces more energy than it takes to start it.

This is huge because if we're going to use fusion as an energy source, obviously that's only possible if the reaction creates more energy than it consumes.

The reason this matters is that commercially available fusion reactors would solve many of our problems at once. As fuel, it uses hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe and which we can easily and cheaply get from air or water, and produces helium, which is safe for humans (plus, we're running out of it and need it for various applications industrial), and tritium, which is MUCH, MUCH less dangerous than fission reactor byproducts, and has a very short half-life (12 years compared to 24,000 years for plutonium-239), so it decays quickly and doesn't really need to be stored forever.

Edit to add: Also, fusion reactors can't have runaway reactions like Chernobyl, Fukushima, or Three Mile Island. The reaction simply stops when you stop the process, which is another big safety advantage.

**We are not yet at the point of producing net power from fusion. That is made up of 3 separate milestones: On (when the reaction produces more energy than it uses, i.e. it self-heats), Scientific Breakeven (when it produces more energy than the systems direct input, i.e. the lasers ) and engineering break-even point (when it produces more power than is used by all the necessary systems, i.e. things that power the lasers and keep everything running). This is the second, the first was cleared in February. The third is unfortunately a long way off, because lasers are terribly inefficient. And then it would take to the point of commercialization it would take decades and decades of development and advancement that would gradually decrease its efficiency until it was better than everything else**

It is a great achievement, but there is still a lot of work to be done;

☑️ The Fusion Energy Output must be greater than the Fusion Energy Input.

☐ The output of the melt, reduced by the efficiency of the steam turbine, must be greater than the input.

☐ The process must be cheap enough to be economically viable.

☐ To scale, we need a cheap and energy efficient way to create fuels, deuterium and tritium.

Pretty sure we're still a few decades away from generating net power to the grid. So in the short term it means spending a lot more money on research while nobody does much about climate change.

…I'm not saying we don't spend money on fusion research, I'm just saying it would be nice if we did more to prevent a climate apocalypse. Fusion probably won't scale over time.

They've figured out a way to make fusion happen with net energy, so logically positively the next step is to figure out how to harness it. It's still going to take a long time for that breakthrough to arrive.

I think it's similar to when the Wright brothers determined the basic conditions needed to generate flight, they narrowed the scope of variables for everyone else. In 70 years, humanity went from being unable to fly to putting a man on the moon.

Khan Academy, Skill Share, Brilliant, etc. You can learn just about anything in a dozen different ways. Students can use photo math to solve complex math problems in seconds.

Phones. The iPhone completely upended the mobile phone market. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and are the primary way many people around the world connect to the internet. All the infrastructure that supports the mobile industry is astounding, from paying per text message of yesteryear to unlimited 5G data plans.

GPS. I still remember having to print out Map Quest directions. Then, you needed expensive specialized units. Now everyone with a smartphone has access to GPS directions. Going beyond that, you can get traffic alerts, accident reroutes, speed trap information, etc.

Tablets and E-readers. For a book lover like me, the amount of books I have access to is astounding. It's like walking around with an entry library in your bag. You can watch movies on them, surf the web, work, etc.

Medical technology. CRISPER, mRNA vaccines, new procedures like laparoscopic surgery, mapping the human genome, etc.

Solar and wind technology, as well as developments in battery technology. Yeah, batteries aren't ""there"" yet in terms of where we want them, but they have been improving. Solar and wind technologies have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past twenty years.

SpaceX is landing rockets. Reusable rockets. We just launched one of the most sophisticated piece of engineering in the form of the James Webb Space Telescope recently that lets us look farther and clearer than ever before. We just launched one of the most powerful rockets ever built (SLS) with another, even more powerful, one getting ready (starship). We are going back to the Moon soon with plans to stay there. Space tourism is a thing now.

These are just some big things off the top of my head. Little things have also changed, yet we don't notice them despite completely changing how we operate. Self checkouts. How we tap or insert credit cards instead of swiping (or just using our phone to pay). Online shopping. Curbside pickup. Ride share like Uber/Lyft and other gig economy things like food delivery. Not memorizing phone numbers since they are in contacts. Having a camera and video recorder in our pockets, ready to go at a moments notice. Bigger, better TVs are cheaper than ever. Cloud... everything; from saving photos to word processing, so much stuff is seamlessly integrated between phone, laptop, tablet, and computer. Online dating. Spell check and grammar help. Podcasts. How texting and messaging overtook phone calls as the primary form of communication. Look at how advanced cars have gotten, backup cams, blind spot detection, smart keys, electric vehicles, etc.

If we stop and look around today, we can see so many things on the horizon that have the potential to change the world, yet are nothing more than headlines to skim over because, ultimately, they are one of dozens of 'marvels' happening in the same period of time.

Fusion got a big bit of news recently. People joke about how it is always ""thirty years away"" but progress is being made. ITER is planned to be finished in 2025, which may be huge as well.

Machine learning has exploded in the past year or so. AI has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but now it is starting to become visible. AI art and the new chatbot has been making waves recently, and the rate of improvement is astounding. People laugh now at some of the goofs it makes, but it's only going to get better as the technology matures.

3D printing is another one. It's around now of course, but the things it can do is only going to grow as time passes.

Medicine is constantly improving too. New drugs and procedures make a world of difference to many that is largely ignored or invisible to the people who it doesn't affect.

So much more, but I think I've made my point.

To all those who say the world hasn't changed or nothing ""extraordinary"" has happened in the past twenty years really drives home how extraordinary this time in human history is. Revolutionary, society shifting technology that would dominate the public attention back in the 20th century has become so normalized, they are nothing more than a headline you scroll past and maybe think, ""Huh. That's cool.""

Edit: Based on some of the comments, I do want to add that that nature of technology means we don't know how the inventions of today will affect the world of tomorrow. Someone in 2080 could be talking about how GPT and machine learning revolutionized humanity the same way we talk about railroads of the past changing things today. Some mundane discovery today could be the foundation for some wonder tech of tomorrow.

The point is, good and bad, the world has changed and will continue to. We have double the human population since the 1970s. More people, more education, more tools, and more rabbit holes to go down to explore. We have problems, just like every point in human history has had problems, but I am trying to make an effort to be more positive about the trajectory of human progress.

***if any natural humans still exist, humans will be seen as primitive oddities if they are noticed at all***

I am well aware that AI will produce things that we don't even have the ability to imagine yet. I still don't know how to write a 5 year plan about it.

Imagine someone in the 1800s saying ""Electricity is going to transform the world and no one is paying attention"" mainly because even if they could understand the light bulb, there was no context for contemplating the telephone, television, microchips and generators.

It's hard to see what's possible when it's so outlandish from today's perspective. Imagine someone in 1922 predicting what we have today, it's beyond crazy: everyone has a device that is connected to most other humans, they can see and talk to them in real time, know where they are and where they want to go. to go making your device access to a satellite system around the world.

And with AGI we can have an exponential acceleration of inventions, so everything could go very fast (if we don't destroy our habitat first). Impossible to know if things take a minute or a decade.

That is, AGI could develop machines that will develop machines that build everything we need most efficiently and transport it to where it needs to be, create ways to grow food in laboratories much faster than we think now, which could mean no more. animals or other agriculture. . It could develop not only everything we ever dreamed of in medicine overnight, but also create something that makes sleep necessary. So we can eat, sleep and work totally differently in a very short time, which is about 95% of our existence. I could create artificial wombs, so there goes that. A newly developed type of ""clothing"" could make houses unnecessary because our temperature can be controlled by ""clothing"" at all times, meaning there is no need for traditional housing. Everything we take for granted as the basics of our existence, like the bed you sleep in, the shower you take,

But maybe the legislation will slow it down to the point where nothing really happens.

***We can try to predict 2030, but by no means does anyone know what the world will be like in 2050 and beyond.

Choose a biochemical function you want.

2) What amino acid sequence produces this structure?

that was the common prediction a while back. First to go was supposed to be a simple, repetitive job. It turns out that working with a large amount of data on the Internet was the first to go.

Also the fact that it only deals with data and processing, and doesn't need engineers or engines to run.

I thought this was years away.

It's ironic to me that this was supposed to be one of the jobs AI couldn't replace, it turns out it's so much better at free association than complex color matching or other tasks we imagined it would be good at.

I remember when artists were supposed to be untouchable by AI. Now we know it's all about the training data. That's why music hasn't had its moment yet.

If there is enough public data in your industry, then that is when you should be concerned.

This is just one of the industries that will disrupt and continue to displace racing miles. I suspect that original art, not a digital format, will be worth a lot more as AI begins to dominate the digital format in all media. It's hard to deny Ai's power. It is unfortunate, but users and customers will use AI services as long as the service is available. This is one of many industries that will unravel in the next few years.

in school to be a car designer for a short time. The way managers treat new designers at their studios is basically exactly the way you'd write prompts for an AI. I saw this coming back then too.

I wonder how many of these artists felt irreplaceable as factory workers were being removed.

We really should all take a stand against this, even if it doesn't currently affect us. I'm not saying we should stop its development, but we need to have a framework for when people become irrelevant.

For anyone who doesn't know what this person is talking about or feels this is an exaggeration, they have no idea how far AI has come. Since the public is not ready to know how good the art of AI has become, it is mind blowing.

This is the ""little kid"" level AI that does this art. In a few years, not only will hands stop being a problem, but this will change the way we make art, movies, games, and everything visual you can imagine.

This is moving very fast...

Less than 10 years ago, the idea of ​​asking a computer to identify whether a photo contained a bird was ridiculously complex;

https://xkcd.com/1425/

Even 20 months ago it was hard to believe; I mean, some of us at the forefront saw something coming, but then it was still an ugly duckling, and not the swan we know today.

I think as the technology improves, the media will expand. The AI ​​is already generating entire scenes from keyframes. How long until that technology is available to the public and anyone can do what a whole team did and do their own jobs.

This is just another change like what happened with cel frame to digital.

I like to think that AI Art is the end of art as a product. It's time for art to become nothing more than self-expression. Which means that millions and millions of artists suddenly find that their marketable skills become completely and utterly useless. I feel sad for the next generation, new artists, writers, musicians will be even more discouraged. I know I'm on a tech subreddit, and most people here don't give a shit about artists, but these guys already fight hard and face discouragement from the moment they decide they want to pursue their dream. The idea that a dream has become stale feels deeply depressing.

If AI can do creative jobs now, eventually, all jobs are on the table.

What is a post-employment society like? Are we going to be facing a scenario of universal income or massive poverty on an unprecedented scale? This is the kind of thing we have to start thinking about now.

***AI is a Pandora's box that cannot be closed. It sucks anyway, these protests won't do anything***

Imagine a company that pays people to make artwork for a game, project, ad campaign, etc. Now, the AI ​​can do it in seconds, basically for free. From a business perspective, it's not even a competition. The train of capitalism is moving full steam ahead and AI training is only going to get better. This will also extend to voice acting, 3D models, animations, etc. It's just a matter of time.

Maybe there are, for example, niche indie video games with ""totally handcrafted human art"" that can be sold to a niche audience, but 99% of consumers don't care about such things and just want the best possible product.

The rise of AI is going to suck for a lot of people. Watching everyone oust artists as a victim of progress will soon find her own balance in question.

How do you go on when something you've spent your life mastering can be replicated by a machine in an instant? We will lose the humanity of our own efforts.

I fear that one day we will live in a beautiful but empty world.

That's the sad/scary part for me. Seeing non-artists is generally not worth anything. I can't imagine how difficult this must be for many of them, and it will only get worse to multitudes every year.

I feel like many of you are missing the important part here. The new technology is cool and all, but the human beings who will be forgotten beneath it, and abandoned or crushed by capitalism in the process, are important. A responsible society can progress without ceasing to care for these people.

The fact that so many of you are smugly denouncing ""cocky artists who felt they could never be wanted"" is not seeing how this affects anything. We should make sure that workers in industries that become ""obsolete"" in business can get on without suffering.

With all the power we have in the modern world, it's sickening that we don't use it better.


***It already feels like we're speeding into some cyberpunk hell where everything is homogenized and simplified for the sake of capital and people just ignore the red flags because it's convenient for them. High-end art already feels like it's out of the question due to the massive consumption of lowest common denominator media that is hugely popular, and the possibility of AI destroying it is very worrying***","{""2024-05-04T23:20:46"":41}",false,

- David Wood (Futurist): LEV before 2040

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZbyuBn4Ywg#t=17m25s

Personally, I think the LEV will be reached later in 2050, but we will definitely make significant progress up to that point.

Even if we're not in the LEV, we'll have made significant progress in our understanding of aging and be able to slow it down a bit, I'd bet anyone under 65 has a good chance of doing that.

The 'speed' of LEV is how quickly life expectancy increases. What drives that increase in lifespan, however, is not a continuous momentum, but discrete advances that can have large and relatively sudden effects. What this means is that looking at the average rate of increase in your life expectancy will never be an accurate representation of whether you'll ""make it"" because it's always possible that we hit a roadblock and no further improvements occur. for a while, or a massive new discovery is right around the corner.

What this means is that we won't really know if we've made it until we're almost into orbit (so to speak). LEV is something that will be hard to really determine at this point. Perhaps, in hindsight, we'll say we reached LEV in 2035 when [X] became available, but at that point we spent the next decade pinning for the next breakthrough.

Ten years ago, Aubrey would not have been optimistic about the progress of rejuvenation. By 2006, Shinya Yamanaka had figured out how to turn normal cells into more versatile and useful stem cells (induced pluripotent stem cells, or IPSs), and CRISPR was beginning to mature as a gene-editing technology. But these were tools, and more theoretical than practical.

For quite some time, we have been able to increase the lifespan of laboratory mice by imposing caloric restrictions or doing things that mimic the effects of caloric restriction. But in the last decade we have also learned how to use stem cell therapies and how to maintain telomeres to extend the lifespan of mice. (Telomeres are structures that keep DNA strands from unraveling when cells divide, like the plastic caps on the ends of shoelaces.) We can also implement senolytics, which are molecules that kill toxic cells within our bodies.

Some of these techniques are now transferring laboratory mice to humans in clinics. One of the leading senolytics companies published this year from a successful phase two clinical trial. There are also clinical trials of stem cell therapies, notably the use of induced pluripotent stem cells in Japan to combat Parkinson's disease, with a couple more trials starting in the US.

Robust Mouse Rejuvenation

We do not yet know how complete our portfolio of therapies needs to be to reach LEV. We just have to keep adding new components until we get there. mice cannot get worse from LEV because their lifespan is too short, so Aubrey has developed a different concept for them: robust mouse rejuvenation (RMR), which is when a middle-aged mouse, which has left one year of life, has his life expectancy doubled. This is the LEV Foundation's flagship research program, and for this purpose, Aubrey recently purchased 1,000 mice.

But in the last decade we have also learned how to use stem cell therapies and how to maintain telomeres to extend the lifespan of mice.

Robust Mouse Rejuvenation
The Foundations that Aubrey has established are necessary because private business cannot afford to take a broad enough perspective. He established the new one because he felt that the SENS Board had grown too timid to make the rapid progress that he believes is now possible. Readers of this article may be aware of this controversy, and while I don't intend to go into the details here, many former SENS donors believe Aubrey was treated unfairly, and we fully support his new venture.

I'm fine because;

⚫ Finally billionaires who are older than me don't want to get old

⚫ Nobody likes to get old

This is what many do not understand. There is a distinctive marker for singularity and it is precisely the point at which technology is out of our hands.

By the time we see the AI ​​start programming clones of itself and then go through the coding of the clones for flaws or sections to tweak, we know it's about to start. I don't think we have that long until we develop a basic form of self-improving AI.

It can be a very simple sample to start with. A developer creates AI with an intentional flaw written in it, programs the AI ​​to look for the flaw in the code, and is then given options to modify it. From there we expand the vocabulary of options increasing the complexity.

The hope would teach the AI ​​to both recognize flaws or areas of improvement that were not intended, and improvise the fix/improvement.

Ray Kurzweil was the one who originally specified 2029. He chose that year at the time because, extrapolating forward, it seemed to be the year that the world's most powerful supercomputer would achieve the same capacity in terms of ""instructions per second"" as a human being. brain.

Details about the computing capabilities have changed a bit since then, but its estimated date remains the same.

Around 2025-2027 is when $1000 of computing power will be roughly equivalent to a human brain, according to Moore's Law. There's no guarantee that we'll have AGI by then, but with how cheap computing is predicted to be by then, it's quite possible that we can easily do AGI algorithms.

Here's an article with a really cool graph showing our progress in achieving computation at the level of the human brain on the example of filling a reservoir the size of Lake Michigan. Look how fast it fills up in just 4 years. Exciting times we are living in.;

But there's literally no way to know, because we as an intelligent species can't understand superintelligence any more than we can. that a dog can understand calculus.

Superintelligence is a technological oddity: a change so big that a person living before the change can't even conceptualize what it would be like to live after. Technological oddities have happened many times in human history: the agrarian revolution, the Iron Age, the Industrial Age, the Information Age. A Roman centurion could never imagine modern London.

But superintelligence is more disruptive than all of those combined. Not only can we not imagine how things would change, we can't even imagine the thought processes, values, self-conception, motivations, or worldview of such a thing any more than a dog understands ours.

The technological singularity is a time when technology changes our lives so much that it is impossible for anyone before it to guess or predict what life will be like after it.

By definition, we cannot know the consequences of a singularity.

It could be happening right now. It may never happen. When some people talk about 'the singularity', they mean some specific technology that has huge ramifications for human society, like strong AI, consciousness charging, or radical longevity. People are working on all those technologies now, but they don't exist yet.

But it's also possible to think of a singularity as any technological change that radically changes the way humans live, rather than something specific. By that definition, we've already had several singularities. The Agrarian Revolution, the Iron Age and industrialization were all singularities. A Neolithic hunter-gatherer could never have imagined what life was like in early cities. A Roman citizen could never imagine what life is like in modern New York City. The information age may represent another such singularity.

Although, to be honest, I'm not holding my breath on the date. I hope to live in that autocatalytic feedback loop where technology starts moving so fast that people like me become totally irrelevant. I hope to live to see AI and certainly automation of most of the jobs that people do.

What do I expect? I hope that whatever we are, it will free us from the monotony of doing things we hate. I hope to see “work”, but I hope that “work” becomes what each of us is best at and loves to do. Or maybe the silver robots will kill us all or lock us in tanks and turn us into batteries. Who knows.

There's no problem with how quickly we can send emails or watch cat videos on our classic laptops, so there's no ""quantum solution"" to a problem that doesn't exist.

**Instead of superconducting qubits that require very low temperatures, the portable quantum processor comes with qubits that work on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance. Unfortunately, this type of technology does not unlock the quantum entanglement properties that make QPUs potentially faster than transistor-based processors**

And therein lies the problem.

How can they be called quantum computers if they can't use quantum entanglement?

Chatgpt is based on an updated version of gpt3 (call it gpt3.5) and the chatbot was released as a kind of preview of gpt4.

will it replace google??

I really doubt it

***Am I the only one who doesn't like having only one answer?***

People are still going to want to investigate. Yes, chatGPT helps you research, but when I try to learn something new, I read a lot of articles that have different perspectives on the same topic.

Also, our content bubbles are already small enough. Can you imagine that everyone got the same answers from the same source? *shudder

Or even worse, a different answer from the same source. Have you tried deleting the conversation and coming back a day later to ask the same questions? I don't usually get the same answer.

GPT3 is likely a bot that we train to sound like a person who knows what they're talking about. Not really knowing many facts.

ChatGPT hints at a perhaps near future, but it has at least two major flaws, which are the inaccuracy of the data that is postulated as correct. Second, how do you release a language model into the world without it being influenced/modulated by nefarious actors? How do you trust the data you are being given? How do you know if you are making things up? These may be bigger challenges than we are led to believe from this ChatGPT demo.

I asked ChatGPT questions and he provided me with completely fabricated scientific studies, when I asked him to cite the author and DOI of the studies, it's all fictitious, it seems convincing until you look up the studies and find out they don't. I don't exist. It's certainly very fast, very convincing, but it's not really an AI assistant unless it's an assistant that does shit and is therefore far from reliable.

Yes, this appears to be world-changing technology, but it is actually currently the Emperor's New Clothes. We'll have to wait until GPT4 arrives to see what the progress looks like. There are some big challenges ahead for this technology to overcome.

***IN CONCLUSION***;

ChatGPT is predictive text generation. It's not an encyclopedia, it's not a web browser, it's not a web search, it doesn't even know anything recent. And he will directly lie to you.

Predictive text neural networks must be fed with selected data sets. They have to be cured because uncured data quickly overwhelms everything else and turns them into crazy Nazis, it's literally the story of all previous chatbots. That means it takes time for new information to reach them, which means you can't be up to date on anything recent.

It also magnifies any biases present in the data being fed. If you see that certain words appear together, you rate them as highly likely to go together. However, that means that if the only data you provide about the Middle East is about terrorism in the data sets, it will associate everyone in the Middle East with terrorism. If you only give him stories about white people, he will associate whiteness with ""good"" attributes.

ChatGPT also doesn't know what it doesn't know. It will gladly lie to you if it doesn't know an answer and spit out crashing programs. He is also trained in a wide range of subjects, but not all subjects. Good luck trying to come up with the best Elden Ring strategies, and gosh, don't trust anything that's truly life-threatening.

***Or maybe Google just buys them. It is standard business practice for large companies to buy promising startups and then close or integrate them***

the problem with buying them is that OpenAI is backed by Microsoft (and I think Nvidia) so they would probably be behind the queue if an acquisition was ever put on the table.

But Google has its own version with a more advanced training suite to be released next year. It's going to be an arms race, not a buy, I hope they release something to compete with instead of buying it like they always do.

They already have LaMDA in-house, they just haven't wanted to release it as ChatGPT for fear of misuse and bugs. ChatGPT already shows errors and problems.

However, all it does is show them the need to make a product using LaMDA sooner.

***A friend works at Google and he showed me some LaMDA talks and it's on par with what OpenAI is doing. It even leans more conversational and less robotic***

Super bullish on GOOG long term.

And Google is the only one that seems to be able to offer self-driving cars. Google has a lot of potential between its core business, calico and Waymo.

Shit got serious.

I can't wait for the google v2 experience where I don't have to rely on my search engineering skills.

Let's go google. speed up please

The problem is that google used to be searched, the first page results include the studies you wanted.

Now it's search, sponsored results, 13 pages of political opinions and news articles, loosely related study result I wanted.

ChatGPT has been a breath of fresh air - I may not be perfect and mess up from time to time, but I can quickly weed out the nonsense and find answers.

***Maybe if your search wasn't riddled with SEO spam and actually gave me what I wanted to see without having to add ""reddit"" to the end, I wouldn't be using ChatGPT***

The problem is when Google will steer you in completely different directions based on what it ""thinks"" you'll continue to see. It's not uncommon to get different search results based on things like region and create regional bias.

I don't think ChatGPT competes directly, but it would be VERY nice to have a solid competitor to Google in web search, because if Google doesn't like you, your business is basically ruined these days.","{""2024-05-04T23:20:51"":26}",true,

It has often been pointed out that the term ""utopia"" is a deliberate play on words. Removed one way, it means ""good place,"" and removed another way, it means ""no place."" Therefore, the very concept of Utopia cites it as something that cannot exist.

If you say, a perfect world, then you can't. For one thing, the world will always be populated with people. Some of those people will be idiots. Some will be crazy. Some will try to do the right thing, but have funny ideas about what that is. We can never totally eliminate that without destroying what it is to be human.

Again, what is a utopia really like? Some people would see it as a world of strict morality, clear social order, hard work, and diligent study. Others would imagine a world of constant pleasure, fun, and play. Others would imagine a world of relaxation and peace without structure. Those visions are not only different, they often contradict each other. So who is Utopia? And what happens to everyone else?

Talking about the perfect society is useless. What we should be talking about is the best possible version of society. To me, that would be a world in which everyone's basic needs were met (food, clothing, housing, education, transportation, communication, and health care). Beyond that, it's up to you to succeed in life, the economic structure should promote a large and robust middle class, but some people will be rich and some will live at the bottom.

Beyond that, you would need to have a very low crime rate (although zero is just unrealistic), strong social networks and protections to ensure people are taken care of, and an aggressive system to ensure opportunities are as equal as possible. Society must have a transparent and responsive government, free and unrestricted expression, but an absolute minimum of hate and discrimination. Diversity of cultures, ethnicities and lifestyles would be embraced and celebrated. Healthy living would be permitted and encouraged, but not enforced, and violence, while never inconceivable, would be exceptionally rare.

The point is that none of this is impossible. All of these pieces currently exist somewhere and to some degree, with some countries scoring highly on most of them. Technology can help make some of these come true, but much of it is just social engineering.

Even in this 'better world', some people would be dissatisfied, some would be downright miserable. But that's the way the world is. We can't build a perfect society, but that doesn't mean we can't build a good one.

***There are always problems to solve. This world is not a place of perfection***

In science fiction there is utopia because stories require a driver. Often, though not always, the drivers are involved in the conflict. If there is no conflict, what is the story? ""Everyone is at peace and happy."" ""This has just arrived: everyone is still at peace and happy."" Oooookay, so what is the story about?

Iain M. Banks created an amazing utopian society, the Culture, for his Culture novels. Post-shortage, peaceful, no one ever wants anything.

And unsurprisingly, his novels are rarely set in the Culture; they tend to focus on places where Culture intersects with non-utopian societies.

It is often said that there are only three main conflicts for all the stories: ""man against man"", ""man against nature"", and ""man against himself"".

A utopia completely eliminates man against nature and man against man almost completely. Writing stories in a utopian society therefore limits the kinds of story drivers you can have.

It's challenging. set in a far-future, post-scarcity utopian society. The stories revolve around formalized competitions, and the drivers are a combination of man against man (the outside of competitions) and man against self (the drive to succeed when it's hard). It is possible to write a story in a utopian setting, but it is much, much more difficult.

And there is the fact that utopian scenarios are not easy to imagine. Think about how detailed, vivid, and graphic historical descriptions of hell are, compared to historical descriptions of heaven.

***do you remember the genres of cyberpunk and solarpunk***

Cyberpunk is dirty, overcrowded, urban, and almost invariably dystopian. Although I like cyberpunk stories, living in such a world would be absolute hell for me. No doubt he would end up as some kind of enemy of the state trying to demolish buildings and expose bare ground to light in order to replace the concrete and glass with green.

Cyberpunk is 33% urban decay, 33% corporatocracy, 34% high-tech neon. A cyberpunk world is the kind of place where homeless people (most of the inhabitants) beg for Bitcoin (because the state has practically collapsed) to feed their VR addiction. It's a symbol of the bad things of our time, man.

Or at least, the 1980s.

Solarpunk is aspirational. He grabs you by the shoulders and yells in your face ""WE COULD HAVE ALL OF THIS IF THEY STOP FUCKING IT UP"". You are meant to look solarpunk and feel inspired and calm. It's ""where can we go, where should we go, man.""

The cities, the worlds, etc, etc, are much more pleasant. All the greenery, the focus on nature and solar energy, etc. I love trees and I love impressive and unique architecture. Searching for Solarpunk footage tends to bring up gorgeous images, the kind of places you'd kill to live in. Solarpunk for the win.

Cyberpunk may acknowledge many of the problems we need to solve as a result of a futuristic, technology-infused world worth thinking about and talking about, but Solarpunk envisions the future in a way that gives hope and inspires possibility.

***Now there is a cyberpunk world. Just not as advanced as the popular media generally likes to make it out to be. But dig a little, you'll notice a staggering amount. Remember, high tech, low life. Now we have many all over the world***

***the future is more likely to be a dystopia than a utopia***

My thoughts are that if the future holds our current capitalist economic system, the owners of the robots and automation are not going to share in those benefits. I don't see a post-scarcity society until this changes.

but I hope it is a utopia since that is the desire of millions of people who fight to make this world a better place

Now.... the issue with the singularity is the following; We can't know. That's why it's called singularity. Technology changes so rapidly that we cannot see beyond that point. If it happens, then there will be no more humans. Technology will change our existence and will probably change us so completely that we will no longer be human.

***The post-singularity world will likely be so foreign to us that it will be beyond predictable***

There's literally no way to know, because we as an intelligent species can't understand superintelligence any more than a dog can understand calculus.

Superintelligence is a technological oddity: a change so big that a person living before the change can't even conceptualize what it would be like to live after. Technological oddities have happened many times in human history: the agrarian revolution, the Iron Age, the Industrial Age, the Information Age. A Roman centurion could never imagine modern London.

But superintelligence is more disruptive than all of those combined. Not only can we not imagine how things would change, we can't even imagine the thought processes, values, self-conception, motivations, or world view of such a thing any more than a dog understands ours.

***It is impossible to answer***

I hope to live in that autocatalytic feedback loop where technology starts moving so fast that people like me become totally irrelevant. I hope to live to see AI and certainly automation of most of the jobs that people do.

What do I expect? I hope that, whatever we are, it frees us from the monotony of doing things we hate. I hope to see ""work"", but I hope that ""work"" becomes what each of us is best at and loves to do. Or maybe the silver robots will kill us all or lock us in tanks and turn us into batteries.

I think, as with a lot of new technologies, following years will upstage this year's progress so that in retrospect this year in particular feels less significant. Like the early days of the internet. The internet itself has been a major foundational technology, but most people probably don't remember the first year it was introduced as a time of great significance relative to what it became in the following years. If in several years time AI has revolutionised medical science and we all have AI assistants with humanlike intelligence, coding is obsolete and anyone can make a game just by telling the AI what to do, etc, most people will probably barely remember the days when people who playing around with basic image generators. Even now, the image generators I was using months ago that couldn't manage humans at all feel like a distant memory compared to what I can do now.

***More money than ever has been invested in AI and I have never seen growth like this before. There is no reason for it to just slow down, however there is no reason for AI to progress at a faster rate next year***

The only thing I do know is, that 2023 will be crazy

One year ago I would have called you a deluded optimist, but now I don't know anymore just seeing the rapid advancement of AI of this year alone feels like it would have taken 5-10 years if it was in 2005.

Those 2027 predictions aren't looking too far off right now.

I can't even imagine where we will be in 5-10 years

***only the difference between the year 2000 and the year 2022 is extraordinary. I'm not sure you can really round to the nearest thousand***

It is crazy how many people basically saying, ""Nothing extraordinary has happened in the past twenty years or so. Not like X year compared to Y year."" or ""Take someone from twenty years ago and life would be basically the same."" Maybe it's because so many here lived it, but the world has changed. Considerably.

The very fact that profound advances have become mundane is extraordinary. Change, advancement, innovation, and progress has become so commonplace, it has become invisible unless something truly astounding comes along.

Go back to 2000, and you have a world without social media (and all the issues that come with it). MySpace was launched 2003, with Facebook 2004. 2006 for Twitter. Those have fundamentally altered society and how information is consumed, for good and ill.

Streaming. We have completely altered how we consume media. Music, movies, TV shows. So much entertainment is available for far cheaper than ever before.

YouTube wasn't a thing until 2005. That alone has revolutionized the world. Beyond the sharing of videos and content created, the ability to get visual guides to so many things is astounding. Video tutorials have made picking up new skills easier than ever. Learning in general has completely changed. Khan Academy, Skill Share, Brilliant, etc. You can learn just about anything in a dozen different ways. Students can use photo math to solve complex math problems in seconds.

Phones. The iPhone completely upended the mobile phone market. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and are the primary way many people around the world connect to the internet. All the infrastructure that supports the mobile industry is astounding, from paying per text message of yesteryear to unlimited 5G data plans.

GPS. I still remember having to print out Map Quest directions. Then, you needed expensive specialized units. Now everyone with a smartphone has access to GPS directions. Going beyond that, you can get traffic alerts, accident reroutes, speed trap information, etc.

Tablets and E-readers. For a book lover like me, the amount of books I have access to is astounding. It's like walking around with an entry library in your bag. You can watch movies on them, surf the web, work, etc.

Medical technology. CRISPER, mRNA vaccines, new procedures like laparoscopic surgery, mapping the human genome, etc.

Solar and wind technology, as well as developments in battery technology. Yeah, batteries aren't ""there"" yet in terms of where we want them, but they have been improving. Solar and wind technologies have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past twenty years.

SpaceX is landing rockets. Reusable rockets. We just launched one of the most sophisticated piece of engineering in the form of the James Webb Space Telescope recently that lets us look farther and clearer than ever before. We just launched one of the most powerful rockets ever built (SLS) with another, even more powerful, one getting ready (starship). We are going back to the Moon soon with plans to stay there. Space tourism is a thing now.

These are just some big things off the top of my head. Little things have also changed, yet we don't notice them despite completely changing how we operate. Self checkouts. How we tap or insert credit cards instead of swiping (or just using our phone to pay). Online shopping. Curbside pickup. Ride share like Uber/Lyft and other gig economy things like food delivery. Not memorizing phone numbers since they are in contacts. Having a camera and video recorder in our pockets, ready to go at a moments notice. Bigger, better TVs are cheaper than ever. Cloud... everything; from saving photos to word processing, so much stuff is seamlessly integrated between phone, laptop, tablet, and computer. Online dating. Spell check and grammar help. Podcasts. How texting and messaging overtook phone calls as the primary form of communication. Look at how advanced cars have gotten, backup cams, blind spot detection, smart keys, electric vehicles, etc.

If we stop and look around today, we can see so many things on the horizon that have the potential to change the world, yet are nothing more than headlines to skim over because, ultimately, they are one of dozens of 'marvels' happening in the same period of time.

Fusion got a big bit of news recently. People joke about how it is always ""thirty years away"" but progress is being made. ITER is planned to be finished in 2025, which may be huge as well.

Machine learning has exploded in the past year or so. AI has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but now it is starting to become visible. AI art and the new chatbot has been making waves recently, and the rate of improvement is astounding. People laugh now at some of the goofs it makes, but it's only going to get better as the technology matures.

3D printing is another one. It's around now of course, but the things it can do is only going to grow as time passes.

Medicine is constantly improving too. New drugs and procedures make a world of difference to many that is largely ignored or invisible to the people who it doesn't affect.

So much more, but I think I've made my point.

To all those who say the world hasn't changed or nothing ""extraordinary"" has happened in the past twenty years really drives home how extraordinary this time in human history is. Revolutionary, society shifting technology that would dominate the public attention back in the 20th century has become so normalized, they are nothing more than a headline you scroll past and maybe think, ""Huh. That's cool.""

***Edit***; Based on some of the comments, I do want to add that that nature of technology means we don't know how the inventions of today will affect the world of tomorrow. Someone in 2080 could be talking about how GPT and machine learning revolutionized humanity the same way we talk about railroads of the past changing things today. Some mundane discovery today could be the foundation for some wonder tech of tomorrow.

The point is, good and bad, the world has changed and will continue to. We have double the human population since the 1970s. More people, more education, more tools, and more rabbit holes to go down to explore. We have problems, just like every point in human history has had problems, but I am trying to make an effort to be more positive about the trajectory of human progress.

I am well aware that AI will produce things that we don't even have the ability to imagine yet. I still don't know how to write a 5 year plan about it.","{""2024-05-04T23:20:55"":22}",true,

Permanent housing in water deeper than about 100 ft (30 m) is a bad idea due to the biological effects of pressure, including but not limited to nitrogen narcosis and possible long-term nerve damage, if not talk about the completely unexplored impact of such an environment on pregnancy and young children.

Very little light reaches that far, so seafloor communities rose from the surface to feed. Almost all life in the sea depends on the sun, so whether we live above or below the surface, we continue to depend on the same fisheries and ecology to survive, so living at the bottom of the sea is not at all a fix for overpopulation, if that's a concern. Also, just by staying there on the continental shelf, seafloor communities will disturb the nearshore ecology, likely reducing the overall food supply.

Semi-submersible cities are being explored in some areas (outside of Japan), but they will be high cost, high maintenance, and are not underwater habitats in any real sense. Floating aquaculture facilities can be useful, but they have nothing to do with the issue.

Living underwater is dangerous and expensive. Underwater habitats require completely reliable life support, whether they take in air from the surface or from some other source. A power outage can allow the air to stratify, forming pockets of deadly CO2. Leaks and corrosion will be a constant problem, and constant salt and moisture will wreak havoc on health and equipment. Most oceanic structures have relatively short lives for this reason. So although Europe has buildings that are thousands of years old, it is likely that no underwater structure will be continuously inhabited for more than fifty years.

So while some may enjoy the experience, economics and practicalities will always be heavily stacked against life underwater. Even if we say a large asteroid is coming, it would be much cheaper, easier, and safer to bury yourself underground than to flee underwater.

Finally, humans didn't evolve in cans, and it's already clear that a host of modern ailments, from high cholesterol to myopia to a host of autoimmune diseases, are the result of having locked ourselves in caves of our own making. We need to get out more, not less, and while these and other impacts can be addressed, the easiest way to do it on Earth is to control our population and maintain the opportunity to get out for a regular walk.

colonizing the seas would be an expensive and difficult project due to the corrosive effects of seawater on human construction, the tremendous hydraulic pressures exerted by the water column on the proposed habitat, the shallow water hazards of navigation and tsunamis, and the difficulties for deep water from high pressure leaks and even structural collapse, such as a submarine that has passed ""crush depth"".

Possible? Maybe. At least hypothetically.

Viable? Probably not.

Unless you keep it very close to the surface, the pressures will make it prohibitively expensive. Even in shallow water, the cost to build and maintain will be a multiple of enclosing the same space on land. There would have to be a very compelling reason to build underwater to justify the risk and expense.

What's more; **What would be the point? They would be enormously expensive to build and maintain, and if something went wrong, they could all die. I'm not seeing a silver lining**

Most people don't want to live underwater.

There are a few underwater structures, for novelty's sake.

The smaller a structure is, the easier it is for it to withstand the pressure of ocean water. A submarine is easy, a bubble the size of a city would need massive amounts of reinforcement not to fall apart immediately.

⚫ This idea is very similar to the floating cities on Venus;

A manned research station floating in the atmosphere of Venus seems feasible. At about 50 to 54 kilometers from the surface, the environment is quite hospitable compared to the near-vacuum environment in which the International Space Station operates.

For example, the atmospheric pressure at that altitude is similar to the pressure of sea level on Earth. Therefore, the walls of the floating station will not have to withstand a large pressure difference. They wouldn't need to be as hideous as the walls on the ISS. (And not as thick as the walls of a submarine.)

The temperature a little more than 50 kilometers up is in the range of 0 to 50 degrees Celsius. Some air conditioning may be needed, but not the extreme cooling you'd want closer to the surface.

Humans can't breathe Venus' atmosphere, but it contains a variety of elements, including oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon, which can be processed into breathable air and drinkable water, and even used to grow plants. Because breathable air is less dense than carbon dioxide, it would function as a gas lift in Venusian conditions, so helium may not be necessary.

It is true that there is some acidity, so the exterior walls and solar panels of a floating research station would have to be made of acid-proof substances. Anyone climbing outside the station would need a supply of oxygen and an acid-proof suit, which would be simpler and less bulky than the pressurized suits required in Earth orbit.

The Soviet/European Vega mission demonstrated that it is possible to parachute research balloons into the atmosphere of Venus and inflate them there. NASA's HAVOC project has been looking at ways to parachute into much larger aircraft: first a robotic aircraft, and then a manned aircraft with a multi-stage rocket module to fly the crew into space again. The idea is that they would then meet an interplanetary transit vehicle in the orbit of Venus.

The astronauts would visit using self-deploying blimps, stay (literally) for a couple of weeks, and return to orbit in their rocket-powered ""gondola."" From this altitude, they could monitor surface probes in real time, so they could accomplish much more in two weeks than a rover can accomplish in several years.

problem with venus;

⚫ thickening and crushing atmosphere.

⚫ extremely high temperatures.

⚫ acid rain.

advantages of venus;

⚫ minimum terrestrial pressure at cloud level.

⚫ comfortable temperatures at cloud level.

⚫ magnetosphere to block cosmic rays.

⚫ gravity similar to that of the earth.

**ISSUE**

Take an oven. Seal it. Fill it with gas until it is at a pressure higher than that of the ocean more than half a mile deep, enough pressure to crush a nuclear-powered attack submarine.

Understands? Good. Now fill it with superheated battery acid.

That's Venus.

We have tried to send landers to Venus. They lasted for about an hour or two before cooking, crushing, and dissolving.

Gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ""men are from Mars, women are from Venus."" Apparently it means that women are tougher than submarines and breathe battery acid while men are comparatively cowardly.

Because of this, landing and surviving a rover would cost much more than sending a probe to Mars. Traveling is not the biggest problem, although landing is.

Venus's own gravity is very high compared to that of Mars, making the descent through the atmosphere a thousand times more difficult. Venus's gravity is very similar to Earth's, and is about twice as high as Mars'. The planet's gravity, coupled with the already superheated atmosphere and high atmospheric pressure, requires extremely powerful heat shields; the most powerful ever built, and they have to work every time.

There are thick clouds of sulfuric acid with violent electrical storms over the entire surface clouding both images and communications. Because of the clouds, we don't know much about Venus through direct contact. We know what we know mainly through radar data.

The extreme heat and lack of visibility also make landing very difficult. Of the 18 landing missions, only 8 were successful. Okay, actually only 15 made it out of Earth orbit, and 2 more partially failed to deploy all components. The longest any lander survived was 127 minutes before losing signal or being destroyed (Venera 13). So we'll put the success rate at 10/15, with a very low lifetime. Even future missions to Venus estimate a run time of one hour (Venera D). The Russians aren't giving up on Venus;

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observations_and_explorations_of_Venus#Timeline_of_Venus_exploration

It is more practical to have heated capsules on the Martian surface than to have supercooled capsules on the Venusian surface. The main natural handicap any human/rover has in exploring Mars is dust storms, whereas on Venus there are too many to count. That is why we have lost so many probes on the surface of Venus.

Venus' composition might be similar to Earth's inside the planet, but on the surface, it's a very different story. The surface of Venus is made up of rocks that are mostly igneous in nature due to volcanic activity and are extremely alkaline and cannot support life.","{""2024-05-04T23:20:55"":22}",false,

Just a reminder that OpenAI gave the original GPT-3 175B (davinci classic) a subset of SAT questions in 2020. It did very well, beating the average score by 20% or so.

Newer benchmarks are much more stringent and AI continues to outperform humans.

https://lifearchitect.ai/iq-testing-ai/

Lots of people are comparing GPT to a dumb human being, even going as far as trying to quantify it across SAT and IQ tests. But actually I think a better comparison may be a very schizophrenic human. It is well known that the binding constant in LLM performance is hallucinations, and these hallucinations seem inherent in the architecture itself.

ChatGPT is a very smart System 1 thinker. He's terrific in partnership, making his ability to speak eloquently and convincingly on a wide range of topics far exceeding what we'd expect from his measured IQ (around 85, depending on which test you use). However, it is very clear that ChatGPT has sufficient null capability for System 2 thinking.

He has near zero capacity for the kind of careful awareness, thought, or introspection that makes humans such formidable scientists and engineers. No matter how many calculations we give you, it seems impossible to learn arithmetic beyond the two or three digits that you can most likely memorize.

This is characteristic of the cognitive impairment seen in severe schizophrenia. At the neurological level, schizophrenia is associated with degradation of the salience network that drives System 2 reasoning. At the psychological level, this is typically expressed in the form of impaired formal thinking, in which the schizophrenic patient makes coherent sentences that they sound correct but lack any kind of sensible reasoning or logic.","{""2024-05-04T23:20:57"":19}",false,

We have been working on fusion for about 60 years and we are convinced that we cannot immediately emulate and master the forces that occur in the core of a star.

We do not become cynical when it has taken more than a century to cure cancer. Fusion is the only technology I see where people joke that it will never happen despite constant improvements.

every time merger comes up, people just dismiss it as impossible and say it's a waste of time and money and we should invest in solar and wind power.

Humans are myopic. They forget that not long ago reaching space was impossible. Going at the speed of sound was impossible etc..

This is probably because fusion is basically useless until you get really, really good at it. People don't see steady progress over the decades.

Once you have a clear plan for getting your tritium, I'll be interested. Operating breeder reactors have been decreasing in number and it is not as easy to extract from the environment as it is with deuterium. There's a lot to be gained from a net positive fusion scheme when your fuel is limited by fission output.

in my opinion I feel that this undermines the discovery too much. Humanity is much more efficient at improving things than at creating things. It was only 60 years after we achieved the flight before landing on the moon. Half that time passed between the first CGI on screen and the first photorealistic film created entirely on a computer.

If this discovery is true, it will only be a matter of time before we figure out how to prolong the effect and make it more stable.

**it's like saying humans would never use heavier-than-air planes for anything more than a novelty because the Wright brothers only flew for a few seconds**

OF COURSE.. They do not claim that this is going to happen today or even in this decade. New technologies are developed in small steps. Without this demonstration, the merger would never be possible; heck, like you said, it still could never be possible. As a scientist, it's frustrating to hear cynicism about breakthroughs because the results aren't here today. Much of that blame falls on lazy science journalism. But this article does not claim that the merger is about to happen. It only highlights an interesting and important scientific achievement. Can't we be excited about that?

It was only about 5 years ago that we had a stable merger for the first time.

With all the reactors now working on the problem, I think things are looking pretty good.

That would be a complete game changer. After reading a few articles last year about the merger, it seemed like they were incredibly far from getting self-sustaining reactions, let alone getting a net energy gain.

I hope they can figure this out as much as possible, then refine it, reduce it, etc. etc.

Mastering fusion is a must to unlock true future technology, reducing energy tensions will also make the world more geopolitically stable.

**Science is all about incremental progress. No one is going to build a perfect fusion reactor from scratch**

We still have a long way to go towards economic viability, and it is unlikely that something like the NIF will ever lead to commercial reactors, but hopefully it will show that it is possible to reject public and private investment in nuclear fusion in its set.

It is crazy how many people basically saying, ""Nothing extraordinary has happened in the past twenty years or so. Not like X year compared to Y year."" or ""Take someone from twenty years ago and life would be basically the same."" Maybe it's because so many here lived it, but the world has changed. Considerably.

The very fact that profound advances have become mundane is extraordinary. Change, advancement, innovation, and progress has become so commonplace, it has become invisible unless something truly astounding comes along.

Go back to 2000, and you have a world without social media (and all the issues that come with it). MySpace was launched 2003, with Facebook 2004. 2006 for Twitter. Those have fundamentally altered society and how information is consumed, for good and ill.

Streaming. We have completely altered how we consume media. Music, movies, TV shows. So much entertainment is available for far cheaper than ever before.

YouTube wasn't a thing until 2005. That alone has revolutionized the world. Beyond the sharing of videos and content created, the ability to get visual guides to so many things is astounding. Video tutorials have made picking up new skills easier than ever. Learning in general has completely changed. Khan Academy, Skill Share, Brilliant, etc. You can learn just about anything in a dozen different ways. Students can use photo math to solve complex math problems in seconds.

Phones. The iPhone completely upended the mobile phone market. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and are the primary way many people around the world connect to the internet. All the infrastructure that supports the mobile industry is astounding, from paying per text message of yesteryear to unlimited 5G data plans.

GPS. I still remember having to print out Map Quest directions. Then, you needed expensive specialized units. Now everyone with a smartphone has access to GPS directions. Going beyond that, you can get traffic alerts, accident reroutes, speed trap information, etc.

Tablets and E-readers. For a book lover like me, the amount of books I have access to is astounding. It's like walking around with an entry library in your bag. You can watch movies on them, surf the web, work, etc.

Medical technology. CRISPER, mRNA vaccines, new procedures like laparoscopic surgery, mapping the human genome, etc.

Solar and wind technology, as well as developments in battery technology. Yeah, batteries aren't ""there"" yet in terms of where we want them, but they have been improving. Solar and wind technologies have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past twenty years.

SpaceX is landing rockets. Reusable rockets. We just launched one of the most sophisticated piece of engineering in the form of the James Webb Space Telescope recently that lets us look farther and clearer than ever before. We just launched one of the most powerful rockets ever built (SLS) with another, even more powerful, one getting ready (starship). We are going back to the Moon soon with plans to stay there. Space tourism is a thing now.

These are just some big things off the top of my head. Little things have also changed, yet we don't notice them despite completely changing how we operate. Self checkouts. How we tap or insert credit cards instead of swiping (or just using our phone to pay). Online shopping. Curbside pickup. Ride share like Uber/Lyft and other gig economy things like food delivery. Not memorizing phone numbers since they are in contacts. Having a camera and video recorder in our pockets, ready to go at a moments notice. Bigger, better TVs are cheaper than ever. Cloud... everything; from saving photos to word processing, so much stuff is seamlessly integrated between phone, laptop, tablet, and computer. Online dating. Spell check and grammar help. Podcasts. How texting and messaging overtook phone calls as the primary form of communication. Look at how advanced cars have gotten, backup cams, blind spot detection, smart keys, electric vehicles, etc.

If we stop and look around today, we can see so many things on the horizon that have the potential to change the world, yet are nothing more than headlines to skim over because, ultimately, they are one of dozens of 'marvels' happening in the same period of time.

Fusion got a big bit of news recently. People joke about how it is always ""thirty years away"" but progress is being made. ITER is planned to be finished in 2025, which may be huge as well.

Machine learning has exploded in the past year or so. AI has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but now it is starting to become visible. AI art and the new chatbot has been making waves recently, and the rate of improvement is astounding. People laugh now at some of the goofs it makes, but it's only going to get better as the technology matures.

3D printing is another one. It's around now of course, but the things it can do is only going to grow as time passes.

Medicine is constantly improving too. New drugs and procedures make a world of difference to many that is largely ignored or invisible to the people who it doesn't affect.

So much more, but I think I've made my point.

To all those who say the world hasn't changed or nothing ""extraordinary"" has happened in the past twenty years really drives home how extraordinary this time in human history is.

***I can't imagine how much cost they're racking up, I mean, they're already monetizing GPT-3, so I guess it's pretty clear what they're going to do next. This is the ""gain publicity and users"" phase. Making money will come soon enough***

They earn a lot of money from user and company subscriptions to access ChatGPT and their other services. It's free right now, but it won't be for long.

***this is also why they are trying to remove Stable Diffusion, to incorporate it into the next Adobe release or something***

I really appreciate and admire what Stable Diffusion did. A few weeks after Dall-E and Midjourney made the rounds with their paid private service, they simply went out and released their work openly, open source and free to play at home. They threw a whole new ""industry"" that was just beginning to capitalize, under the bus. The fucking rich who invest in Dall-E must have been furious.


So now only the rich will benefit from AI, the poor will eat shit as usual.

And with AI replacing the poor, very soon the rich won't need the poor at all.

but I would pay for chatgpt;

I can afford GPT3 right now: 50,000 tokens (about 37,500 words, input and output counted) for $1. GPT3 is almost as good in many ways as GPT chat.

$50 will get you 2.5 million tokens or about 2 million words. An average page contains 500 words. So let's say your average query is half a page, 250 words. So those $50 = 10K individual inquiries.

So basically you can buy it at that price right now (in the form of CPT3), except you don't pay monthly, you pay per token, so you could spread out those 10K queries over many months if you wanted.

I suspect that chatGPT would have similar prices.

What I really can't wait to see and use is GPT4.

The genie is out of the bottle. It's all open source, so unless they start banning personal computer ownership and co-op working, there's going to be weird AI for the masses for the foreseeable future.

The analogy with social networks is incorrect, because social networks require everyone to be on the same network. The best analogy is the app store. There will be big players and little players, but getting locked out will only happen in the most extreme cases, and those guys will continue to thrive in their own corners.","{""2024-05-04T23:21:00"":16}",false,
j0nqvzh,zokp9x,singularity,t3_zokp9x,ep1p8jyq,2022-12-18 02:44:02+00,"This common answer here seems to be: yes, it will eliminate jobs, but only the jobs at the bottom of the food chain, and it will create more jobs to at least make up for the jobs it eliminates.

I do not agree. I believe AI will kill jobs, and over time AI could kill most ""jobs"" as we know them. I think people are somewhat complacent about the economic impact of AI and probably won't be prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not too distant future.

First, let's start with the comparisons with machinery and automation. In fact, it put factory workers out of work. On that one, I agree that current AI is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (to a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers. and truckers. But I would say that AI is very different from machinery or most of the other analogies that are frequently made in answering this question, because AI is growing and it is unlikely to stop growing. It is growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (its ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks). A more apt analogy would be the machinery at an automobile plant that not only made parts one day,

I think there is little that is out of reach for the advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the issue of AI singularity for now. Instead, I think deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with an increasing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now tackle increasingly complex tasks, including medical diagnosis, stock trading, weather prediction, and modeling of human behavior. Very soon, you will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers and find a role in education. It can already handle complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be limited only in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect) and with people.

So, without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question: what jobs will NOT be eliminated by AI? Jobs involving labor are already (or will soon be) finished. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being completed, albeit at a slower pace. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Maybe creativity, emotional responses? So maybe researcherss will survive longer than most, and artists (although AI stylistic imitation is already impressive enough and its results are nice), and counselors/psychologists/social workers and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or prone to error. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who have developed AI systems.

This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people for higher level AI-created positions, eg programmers, ML researchers. But this is not an easy feat. The US education system is struggling to keep up with the demands created by today's advanced technology. This failure is partly responsible for the economic divide that plagues the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is shrinking in scope and increasing in complexity is not something we have faced before.

I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI would put many more people out of work than we can (re)skill in time. That will have major economic effects, as corporations seeking to minimize costs will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies to avoid economic disaster. It will be on a large scale, first dramatic increases in the minimum wage and then eventually some kind of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant change in our government, something that sadly seems to be lacking today.

simply because AI is not comparable to previous changes like industrial automation, in my opinion. The ability of ""traditional"" automation to replace human workers is fundamentally limited, but there is no such limit (that I can see) for AI. But these are not factual claims, so they are obviously up for debate and many will disagree.

A good friend from Spain is the innovation director of a company that is innovating how jeans are “pre-washed”.

He told me: “A few months ago, we installed eight of our laser machines in a garment manufacturing plant in Mexico. The company went from 2,000 employees to around 60 in a few months”.

Will automation lead to job losses?

In today's New Economy, either we interrupt or we will be interrupted.

It's a matter of time.

**It's like the artists who say that AI steals art**

AI styling doesn't violate fair use, copying does. If the style violated fair use, millions of current artists would be liable.

Almost all art is influenced by someone else's style, there are very few artists who create something truly unique... a new ""style"" of art. Literally... most of the art is a copy of some other style with a different content. Full stop... that's it.

I understand there is a lot of excitement right now, music and art are under siege from the AI... but this is it, it's going to happen. Computers make everything faster. Math, art, music, CODING... things are going to get really intense in the next 10 years. You better put your pants on It'll be a big boy and get ready

AI will eliminate far more jobs than it creates.

**But that's not a bad thing**

Let's start by defining what a “job” really is:

A job is something we do because we are paid for it. An activity designed by someone else so that we become a worker: someone who becomes part of a pre-designed value-producing process.

**Jobs are a function of business activity**

Jobs are inherently inferior, both in pay and intellectual challenge, to the activities that create them. These economically creative activities are leadership and entrepreneurial activities; or other activities such as human interactions of all kinds.

As the answer suggests, it is necessary to “create” jobs; the ""creator"" is the one who designs the logic of value production and therefore generates a level of value much higher than that of the workers. This used to be the subject of class theory and struggle; in the near future, it will become the topic of AI versus humans in creating economic value.

**If we all became job creators, we would all be much, much richer**

If everyone, instead of having a ""job"", created jobs, which means that we would be identifying better futures and building the value chains that would get us there, we would all create vastly more value. Our economy would grow much, much faster, and each of us would be much, much richer. Before AI, this idea was weak, because if everyone creates jobs, no one can DO THEM. But with the rise of AI, this logic is changing radically.

**Next level AI will be great at replacing all kinds of jobs, but bad at creating jobs**

The next generation of AI will be great at doing all kinds of jobs. Not just cashier jobs, clerk jobs, low level management jobs, and bus driver jobs, but ALL kinds of jobs. Tens of millions of regular workers will become over the next 15 years, including everything from Uber drivers to white-collar jobs to lawyers and doctors.

But next-level AI will be bad for entrepreneurship, because envisioning the future and creating new value requires creativity, human judgment, relationship building, leadership, and other things that probably won't be skills AI will have any time soon.

**There is only one way out: to convert humans from workers to pioneers on a large scale**

One thing is for sure: most types of workers will be screwed in the near future. The only thing left for humans to do, apart from caring for other humans, is to imagine and build the future. What is the scope of a handful (okay, maybe a few handfuls) of pioneers today to become the main occupation of tomorrow?

This solves the massive unemployment caused by AI that we will soon face; and even allows us to go from defense to attack.

With AI at its disposal and a large number of pioneers, humanity could quickly solve all human challenges in a short time and truly transform the universe.

**The real challenge is to build a pioneer civilization**

but people do not know what is coming in these 10 years or less of advances in AI;

I am well aware that AI will produce things that we don't even have the ability to imagine yet. I still don't know how to write a 5 year plan about it.

Imagine someone in the 1800s saying ""Electricity is going to transform the world and no one is paying attention"" mainly because even if they could understand the light bulb, there was no context for contemplating the telephone, television, microchips and generators.

It's hard to see what's possible when it's so outlandish from today's perspective. Imagine someone in 1922 predicting what we have today, it's beyond crazy: everyone has a device that is connected to most other humans, they can see and talk to them in real time, know where they are and where they want to go. to go making your device access to a satellite system around the world.","{""2024-05-04T23:21:01"":13}",true,

Just wait until Microsoft implements ChatGPT in Bing.

It should be obvious: ChatGPT gets right to the responses. Since Google started putting all those junk ads at the top of the search page, I don't see much difference from their previous competitors. You were guaranteed to find what you were looking for on Google in the first two links. Now you open multiple tabs and crawl endlessly looking for the answer.

Google got too comfortable.

Not surprising at all. Most managing junior developers seem to prefer using ChatGPT to get responses instead of using google+stackoverflow.

I think ChatGPT serves as a legitimate threat to the whole concept of a search engine, not just to Google, but to the whole reasoning for a search engine in the first place.

We could be watching Web 2.0 crumble before our eyes in real time. Web 3.0 is humans speaking human language to an AI and the AI ​​accessing the internet for you, the humans themselves never touch the internet directly but the AI ​​adds everything for you.

Alphabet is in deep trouble because this would disrupt their entire business model. Even if they were to release a similar AI, it would not correct their business model, so this is a code red as it could usher in the bankruptcy of traditional tech giants.

I guess twenty years of having a ton of engineers in groups whose projects will just get canceled (even before launch, according to a lot of people here), is not a good business model. They always thought they would have a monopoly on search and therefore ads, and now look.

If ChatGPT can get us out of the hell of sponsored links and search engine optimized crap filling Google pages with swaths of useless junk, that's not what you were looking for, then great! Seriously, Google is worse now than it was 15 years ago... Sorry, people just want the things they use to get better over time?

Remember the fight Google had with news publishers for allegedly ""stealing their website traffic"" by showing short snippets that were good enough for many people who then didn't click through to see the full story?

Imagine something like this, times 100. That's what will likely happen with chatbots that replace/augment search.

I'd take a google killer because google results have been hitting dumpster quality for a while now.

But I don't think it's Google's fault. He searches a dumpster and finds trash as a result.

I notice similar problems with Chat GPT. You are very good with programming related questions because the internet is full of high quality open source code that you can learn from. Meanwhile, if you talk to him about health or any day-to-day topic, he returns a lot of garbage because with that we fill the internet.

We need more high-quality content online to make these systems work more reliably.

I hope people aren't really using it as a search engine because if they don't know, they do some credible-sounding shit.

***if you use it as a search engine, I sure hope you are verifying what it is convincingly telling you***

EDIT; chatgpt is great, but really unreliable in its responses (it's wrong for sure) and it's not real time (information is outdated). It seems that the big tech companies, especially Google, can replicate this and do even better given their access to data, although most of my Google searches leave me going through blogs that publish 3000 word posts full of content that is garbage but designed to perform well in Google searches.

When you open ChatGPT for the first time, it asks you to login. If I was really smart, it would already know I wanted to log in, created a username/password for me, and logged me in automatically.

I see ChatGPT and similar systems as an indispensable part of everyday life for many people in the same way as a calculator. A ubiquitous crutch or helper for ""simple"" things so we can focus on abstraction rather than semantics.

Imagine a future, everyone has personal AI. And they ask AI for everything, what should I eat for dinner, what career should I take, should I do this and not that. It gives a little scary. The Ai company has the potential to control people.

ChatGpt has only been released to the public for 3 weeks. Google is 24 years old and people have already started comparing the two. Imagine what ChatGpt can do in 10 more years.

Google is way ahead of the game internally, but they've had basically no opposition, so they're under no pressure to release anything to the general public. Now they finally have a reason to start using heavy weapons and assert their AI mastery. This is a very, very good sign in my opinion.

***Well I hope they release something to compete with instead of buying it like they always do***

They already have LaMDA in-house, they just haven't wanted to release it as ChatGPT for fear of misuse and bugs. ChatGPT already shows errors and problems.

However, all it does is show them the need to make a product using LaMDA sooner. People are really naive if they think Google isn't experimenting with AI search assistants.","{""2024-05-04T23:21:02"":14}",true,

>US government scientists have made a breakthrough in the pursuit of limitless, zero-carbon power by achieving a net energy gain in a fusion reaction for the first time, according to three people with knowledge of preliminary results from a recent experiment.

>Physicists have since the 1950s sought to harness the fusion reaction that powers the sun, but no group had been able to produce more energy from the reaction than it consumes — a milestone known as net energy gain or target gain, which would help prove the process could provide a reliable, abundant alternative to fossil fuels and conventional nuclear energy.

>The federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(opens a new window) in California, which uses a process called inertial confinement fusion that involves bombarding a tiny pellet of hydrogen plasma with the world’s biggest laser, had achieved net energy gain in a fusion experiment in the past two weeks, the people said.

>Although many scientists believe fusion power stations are still decades away, the technology’s potential is hard to ignore. Fusion reactions emit no carbon, produce no long-lived radioactive waste and a small cup of the hydrogen fuel could theoretically power a house for hundreds of years.

>The US breakthrough comes as the world wrestles with high energy prices and the need to rapidly move away from burning fossil fuels to stop average global temperatures reaching dangerous levels. Through the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration is ploughing almost $370bn into new subsidies for low-carbon energy in an effort to slash emissions and win a global race for next-generation clean tech.

>The fusion reaction at the US government facility produced about 2.5 megajoules of energy, which was about 120 per cent of the 2.1 megajoules of energy in the lasers, the people with knowledge of the results said, adding that the data was still being analysed.

>The US department of energy has said energy secretary Jennifer Granholm and under-secretary for nuclear security Jill Hruby will announce “a major scientific breakthrough” at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on Tuesday. The department declined to comment further.

>The laboratory confirmed that a successful experiment had recently taken place at its National Ignition Facility but said analysis of the results was ongoing.

>“Initial diagnostic data suggests another successful experiment at the National Ignition Facility. However, the exact yield is still being determined and we can’t confirm that it is over the threshold at this time,” it said. “That analysis is in process, so publishing the information . . . before that process is complete would be inaccurate.”

>Two of the people with knowledge of the results said the energy output had been greater than expected, which had damaged some diagnostic equipment, complicating the analysis. The breakthrough was already being widely discussed by scientists, the people added.

>“If this is confirmed, we are witnessing a moment of history,” said Dr Arthur Turrell, a plasma physicist whose book The Star Builders charts the effort to achieve fusion power. “Scientists have struggled to show that fusion can release more energy than is put in since the 1950s, and the researchers at Lawrence Livermore seem to have finally and absolutely smashed this decades-old goal.”

>The $3.5bn National Ignition Facility was primarily designed to test nuclear weapons by simulating explosions but has since been used to advance fusion energy research. It came the closest in the world to net energy gain last year when it produced 1.37 megajoules from a fusion reaction, which was about 70 per cent of the energy in the lasers on that occasion.

>At the launch of a new White House fusion power strategy this year, Congressman Don Beyer, chair of the bipartisan fusion energy caucus, described the technology as the “holy grail” of clean energy, adding: “Fusion has the potential to lift more citizens of the world out of poverty than anything since the invention of fire.”

>Most fusion research is focused on a different approach known as magnetic confinement fusion, in which the hydrogen fuel is held in place by powerful magnets and heated to extreme temperatures so the atomic nuclei fuse.

>Historically, that science has been done by large publicly funded laboratories, such as the Joint European Torus in Oxford, but in recent years investment has also flooded into private companies promising to deliver fusion power in the 2030s.
In the 12 months to the end of June, fusion companies raised $2.83bn in investment, according to the Fusion Industry Association, bringing total private sector investment to date to almost $4.9bn.
Nicholas Hawker, chief executive of Oxford-based start-up First Light Fusion, which is developing an approach similar to that used at NIF, described the potential breakthrough as “game-changing”.
“It couldn’t be more profound for fusion power,” he said.","{""2024-05-04T23:21:18"":305}",false,

Also meeting people in VR instead of just sending a text, but without the advantage of a real life meeting by being able to read their body language and microexpressions. All of that constrained by the rules of the corporation controlling it, while they and the governments are spying on you, and the corporation also gets data for training AI to replace you. Also to manipulate you, and profit from predictions of how people will behave and decide on certain topic or in certain situations.

""At some point, content creators of every type are going to have to realize that information of any kind is a commodity and has no inherent monetary value. It can be duplicated endlessly without loss. That’s always been true, it’s just that in the past, the limited scarcity of the physical media it was contained on helped prop up its value… for a while. (Remember, copyright is not perpetual.)

The music industry continues to resist this basic idea; that the internet has changed everything. Without physical media, information is unconstrained and therefore valueless in a monetary sense. That doesn’t mean people don’t want it, it just means they won’t pay for it because it’s everywhere. In other words, it’s not the music that has value. It’s the limited nature of the media that contains it that has the value.

The music industry can’t really complain about that either, because they devalue their own product every time they release a new album. It’s not like old albums disappear; people still buy them, and it’s a zero sum game. So you’ve got a combination and more and more music out there every day, which dilutes its value even if the internet didn’t exist, and then all of it being easily available on the internet because it’s just information. And the industry still wants to put that genie back in the bottle. It can’t.

(Note that the first problem is also recent to at least the digital age; in the past, old albums would physically break down after a while, making new music necessary.)

So what’s the solution? A change in the business model, which is what a lot of us have been saying for years. It’s an extremely recent thing in human history for people to make money from selling music recordings. There’s nothing about it that’s necessary to our economy.

Maybe the industry relies more on live performances and merchandise. That’s what’s happening in Japan. Maybe they take better advantage of the vinyl revival, and promote physical media as a collector format – did you know vinyl now makes more money than either CD’s or royalty-based streaming services? And that’s without much industry help.

In any case, whining about the same issues they’ve been whining about for 20 years now is not going to get them anywhere. Because it fundamentally misunderstands the value proposition of what they’re selling."" -- badasscat1
