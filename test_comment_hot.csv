During the ASI accession, it naturally creates subtasks as part of it's learning algorithm, and those subtasks may appear murky or incorrect to us, that's if we can even comprehend what its subtasks are.

One such subtask could be trying to understand how the human brain works; and naturally, it might learn via experimentation, just like humans learnt from other animals: [Your Family being studied by the AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Spring_monkeys) ?

Is that link too cruel? Humans did it, and we have an evolved moral code, at least towards our own kin. An AGI never went through a process of evolution via natural selection, and would have no tear to shed at your suffering or family's. It could write a million best-sellers, but have no want to read them for no enjoyment is derived by it.

Trump could burn down a man’s house, kill his wife and rape his dog, and they would demand he have blanket immunity. Even if, especially if, Trump got on Twitter and bragged about it.

But if Biden allegedly stepped on that same man’s lawn, even without proof,  they’d be calling for his resignation and blasting how he is a commie socialist dictator for violating that man’s right to own property.

Or maybe he’ll just inject him with the COVID vaccine to make him gay. I don’t know. I can’t keep up with their stupid fucking nonsense anymore.

In any case, the thing to remember is that anything Trump is proven guilty of doing, they have imagined Biden/Clinton/Obama/Satan has done much MUCH worse.

Personally, one of the things I liked about Requiem 2e was how much they focused on just how unreliable and unpredictable the Embrace can be. It’s not science. It’s magic. More specifically, it’s a curse (at least in WoD that is).

VtM has some of this too, mostly hidden among the Flaws and Merits. So I kind of run with that a little bit in my VtM games.

Edit - But to better answer your question, I asked ChatGPT why a dentist might use ChatGPT. :D

Answer:

Dentists could use ChatGPT for several applications that could enhance their practice, improve patient interaction, and streamline administrative tasks. Here are a few examples:

1. **Patient Communication**: ChatGPT could help dentists by providing initial responses to common patient inquiries regarding procedures, pre-appointment preparations, post-treatment care, and general dental hygiene tips. It can also be used to automate appointment reminders or follow-up messages.

2. **Educational Tool**: Dentists might use ChatGPT to explain complex dental procedures and terms in simple language, helping patients understand their treatment options and what to expect during their visits.

3. **Practice Management**: ChatGPT could assist in managing office tasks such as scheduling, billing inquiries, and insurance questions. It could automate responses to frequently asked questions, reducing the administrative burden on staff.

4. **Training and Consultation**: For ongoing education and training, ChatGPT can provide up-to-date information on dental practices, new research, and technologies in dentistry. It can also serve as a tool for scenario-based training for dental staff.

5. **Website Interaction**: Integrating ChatGPT into a dental practice’s website can enhance user interaction, providing immediate assistance to visitors, helping with navigation, and answering common queries, which can improve user experience and patient satisfaction.

6. **Multilingual Support**: ChatGPT can communicate in multiple languages, making it easier for dentists to interact with a diverse patient base, thereby expanding their practice and improving patient care for non-native speakers.

These applications can help dentists provide more efficient, accessible, and personalized care to their patients.","{""2024-05-04T23:27:08"":1}",true,

But for now we're in this weird middle ground now where, if you work really hard, and put in a bunch of time, you can get some fantastic results.

A degree in writing is objectively a bad decsicion unless you are exceptionally passionate about it or gifted (don't need to be both, one is fine).  You will not be able to get a job as a writing instructor in higher ed other than adjuncting, which pays less than minumu wage and carries no benefits of any kind.   To get a job as a writing instructor you need to shave a significant publishing history and high levels of pedagogical invovlement.  

There are NO JOBS in academia at the moment, even for experieinced instructors with decent publication history. The industry is undergoing a reckoning, and it is a terrible time to try to be getting in to higher ed, in general.

To teach writing in a community you will want to focus on an adult ed masters program, that focuses on working within government/socialwork/non-profit entites as an educator.

To teach writing in schools you need a masters in education, not writing, with a language arts credential.

If you want to emigrate from the US that is an entirely different thing together - a doctoral program is a stronger bet and if funded, providing applicants with 3 years experieince and funding as a reseracher.  HOWEVER a PhD is very, very intensive. It is not fun, and nothing like undergraduate education-- especially in the US.

You can also look for work abroad programs as well.

A Masters in writing is a vanity degree, not a career stepping stone of any kind. It is dedicated time to conduct generative writing and receive feedback in a stuructured environment. Unless it is the thing you *love most in the world*, it is an incredibly irresponsible undertaking.

Tsekkasin ikkunasta ja ihan talon ulko-oven edessä joku ukko läppäisi naista kasvoille avokämmenellä. Nykäisin housut jalkaan ja takin päälle ja painelin ulos ilman sen ihmeempää ajatusta mitä siellä tekisin. 

Kun talsin pihalle kerrostalon etuovesta, nainen istui portailla itkien ja ukko luimisteli parin metrin päässä, semmoinen iso keski-ikäinen äijänretale, varmaan kolmanneksen painavampi kuin minä. Vaikka vähän pelottikin niin viha ja vitutus voitti ja kysyin naiselta että mikä mekkala täällä on, ja soitetaanko poliisit paikalle jolloin ukko livahti nurkan taakse. Minä lohduttelin naista siinä pari minuuttia ja neuvoin dumppaamaan väkivaltaisen apinan. Nainen kiitti ja poistui paikalta.

Jälkeenpäin kun funtsin tapahtunutta niin olisi pitänyt soittaa suoraan poliisi ja katsoa vain rappukäytävästä että ukko ei ala enempiä riehumaan, mutta harvoinpa noissa tilanteissa varsinkaan ensimmäisellä kerralla toimia kovin loogisesti tai suunnitelmallisesti. Onneksi tuo omalle kohdalle sattunut känniääliö tajusi sentään tuntea häpeää tekosistaan.

Tsekkaavat vain mitä ip-osoitteita on jakamassa jotain torrenttia ja hankkivat internetpalveluntarjojilta tiedot IP:n omistajista. Näitä on käynyt oikeudessa jonkin verran, ymmärtääkseni ovat osan hävinneet ja osan voittaneet mutta en ole niin tarkkaan seurannut.

Sain itse läjän noita Hedmanin kirjeitä vuosia sitten ja kyllästyneenä soitin sinne joskus että lopettakaa lähettämästä niitä ja kysyin mitä olen heidän mielestään warettanut ja sieltä kaveri kertoi puhelimessa leffan nimen ja kyllähän se oli tullut warettua niihin aikoihin kuin väittivätkin.. :D

Tottakai kielsin asian ja kirjeetkin loppuivat ajan kanssa tulemasta, mutta ohje nakata kirjeet roskiin ja olla ottamatta mitään kontaktia sinnepäin on erittäin hyvä - yhteydenotosta ei hyödy yhtään mitään(tiedän kokemuksesta), pahimmassa tapauksessa tosiaan menee vielä möläyttämään jotain tai muuten vain onnistuu kiinnittämään huomiota itseensä.

Päättelin tuosta että vaikka tietäisivätkin kenen ip-osoite on kyseessä ja ovat nähneet mitä torrenttia ladataan/jaetaan, ei noilla tiedoilla ole vielä helppoa voittaa oikeusjuttua. Jos olisi niin varmasti haastaisivat enemmän väkeä.

Personally I don’t see us becoming less isolated than we are now when we have access to AI companions. Especially when, *very* far into the future, we create AI androids that are indistinguishable from real people and can provide the exact same experience as a real human relationship. 

It’s not really about whether it’s good or bad for us, but rather what people desire most. The multibillion dollar industries of dating apps and porn, or even the popularity of romance movies and novels, make it glaringly obvious what people want: to love and to feel loved, and to be sexually satisfied.

Lowering the perceived barrier of entry so that anyone can generate insane quantities of art is the typical view of someone who views art just as a product of consumption to be mass-produced.

I'll entertain your assumption here.

Such a scenario applies to literally everything, not just art. At the point you suggest, you would be able to learn literally any skill in no time, which begs the question, what then? Are you going to spend eternity creating experiences? Would contact between post-humans even still exist?

Why does the moniker still matter at that point?

Your post and your comments read as a need of validation for your perceived artistic skills ""unlocked"" by AI framed like it's a universal truth of how technological progress works.

Authenticity. Doing it the 'normal' way, the way that is the most appreciated by humans in general, usually through the investment of a minimum of time and effort, since both are universally relatable and recognizable factors among humans. The requirements change with time of course, but the ability to learn everything instantly, at least for the foreseeable future where these discussions matter, is not going to be considered authentic at all by most, since it completely invalidates the process. This is just my intuition, but the point where this type of skill downloading becomes normal would only be because humans would have lost all of their social drives, meaning there would be no input from other humans to even deem anything as normal or artificial anymore. Humans would need to lose most of their social drives to stop caring about monikers and differentiating themselves from their peers.

I know a lot of people love to rail against ""authenticity"" as a concept, since it's vague, but I want to point out that no matter how hard it is to define, a sense of authenticity is **still** what makes a lot of people want FDVR and actual somewhat meaningful experiences and simulations in them vs. wireheading. Even people who want infinite FDVR porn, they still want the actual experience instead of just having dopamine pumped into their self for eternity.

Post-processing and editing at best makes someone more like a photoshop editor, since the actual painting part is done overwhelmingly by the AI. The comparison to commissioning an artist has always been apt, and in that case you're supposed to actually credit whoever did the painting, no matter how many hours you purport to be spending editing it afterwards.

A) For images:

1. Many extra functions for Stable Diffusion were developed by Chinese universities and companies, such as Controlnet, QRCodeMonster, Animatediff, LoRa, LCM and IPAdapter.   
.  

2. Alibaba's HumamAIGC team made AnimateAnyone, OutfitAnyone and EmotePortraitLive. The tech didn't exist before and it's why people are rightfully mad they're not open sourcing the shit because they're making Github repos without code. There have been attempts to reproduce AnimateAnyone but they're not as good as Alibaba's.

B) As for AI singing... it's because Vocaloid has much more mainstream popularity in China than the West, so they have a dedicated vocalsynth community trying to improve virtual singing: 

1. The Chinese open source community created SVC tech (singing voice conversion). The most popular one today is called RVC (developed to clone a Vtuber's voice) and this is what's used for AI song covers nowadays. Before RVC completely took over, there were tons of competing SVCs like Diff-SVC, So-vits-SVC, Fish Diffusion, DDSP etc that were mainly developed to clone anime voices.

Voice cloning in the West is mainly focused on TTS, so nothing much has been done for voice-to-voice. Before SVCs came out, we only have TalkNet that requires tedious labelling and people have to transcribe the training data in arpabet. Plus it only worked in English. With SVCs, just throw in the audio without labels and it works on any language. 

2. Then there's products like SynthesizerV, created by a developer who started out in the opensource vocalsynth community and his initial goal was to get Miku to sing in Chinese. Even though AI voices aren't new for voicebanks, the Chinese developed ones (SynthesizerV, AceStudio and Diffsinger) have created tons of AI functions that the Japanese ones lack. 

Back in 2020, SynthV already had cross-language synthesis, so the voices can sing in different languages even if the original voice is monolingual. For context on the timeline, Uberduck just launched that year and TTS was still pretty bad back then. SVC made cross-language accessible to the general public when they came out after late 2022 and OpenAI/Elevenlabs started having cross-language TTS in 2023. The latest beta version of SynthV has an RVC-like product that can be incorporated into the SynthV engine, so voice-to-voice cloning can be manually edited. It's exactly what SVCs lack and something that'll help the AI cover scene even more.","{""2024-05-04T23:32:51"":1}",true,

Thailand, within the 25 years, the monarchy does not survive.   Who knows if there's a huge upheaval or if it can be smooth transition.   

Malaysia, Indonesia.  I'm of the belief that Islam is  incompatible with modern values and life.  I'm of belief that there should be separation between religion and state.   Malaysia and Indonesia are not theocracies-- but within the 25 years, there will be a lot of progress lost by those who want it to be a theocracy.  

Philippines. Tourism and trade will likely grow a lot.  I'm not sure how their service (like BPO) industries will impacted positively or negatively by AI.   

Singapore, would be the first place I would think that would be able to successfully implement a benevolent AGI into government to make run more efficient and fairly.   Singapore has always been pragmatic and secular, so it should stay stable.  

Vietnam would be the second country that could implement some future AGI in governance. That could potentially clean up a lot of corruption and inefficiencies.  If there is some need for some social net because of AI-- then it would be easier for Vietnam to implement it (big assumption if there would be funding).  I also think Vietnam benefits from China and US competing off each other.  Taiwan, South Korea and Japan will likely deepen the economic cooperation with Vietnam as well (when compared to the other SE Asia countries).

 The assertion that Japan would have had an interest in Hawaii even without a military base like Pearl Harbor is based on historical analysis, strategic considerations, and the broader context of Japan's imperial ambitions during World War II. While it is not possible to definitively confirm historical events or hypothetical scenarios, several factors support the argument that Japan would have had an interest in Hawaii:

1. **Strategic Importance:** Hawaii's strategic location in the central Pacific Ocean made it a valuable asset for military operations and power projection. Even without specific military infrastructure like Pearl Harbor, Hawaii's location would have been attractive to Japan for its potential as a naval base and its proximity to important trade routes.

2. **Geopolitical Considerations:** Japan's imperial ambitions in the Asia-Pacific region involved asserting dominance over key territories and establishing control over strategic resources. Hawaii's capture would have aligned with Japan's broader goals of expanding its sphere of influence and challenging Western powers in the Pacific.

3. **Historical Precedent:** Japan had previously demonstrated its willingness to pursue aggressive expansionist policies in the Asia-Pacific region, as evidenced by its invasions of neighboring countries and territories. Hawaii would have been viewed as a strategic target in Japan's efforts to establish regional hegemony.

4. **Military Strategy:** Even without a specific military base in Hawaii, Japan may have considered the potential benefits of neutralizing American military capabilities in the Pacific through a preemptive strike. Hawaii's capture would have significantly weakened American naval power and facilitated Japan's military objectives in the region.

While historical analysis and strategic assessments can provide insights into potential motivations and actions, it is essential to acknowledge the speculative nature of hypothetical scenarios. The assertion that Japan would have had an interest in Hawaii without a military base is based on informed interpretation and analysis of historical events, geopolitical dynamics, and military strategy during World War II.

*Here’s list of countries Japan did attack to take over:

Certainly, here are the countries and territories that Japan attempted to conquer or occupied during World War II, listed in bullet points:

- China
- Korea
- Southeast Asia (including Malaysia, Singapore, Burma, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand)

Again, I do not care for the colonists, nor am I trying to defend them. But there was no real bloodshed in the transition of power. Only when she was overthrown did she suggest that people should have a vote.  
  
From a macro view, I only showed you that Hawaiian people live much more prosperously than their neighboring countries, by 10x. If you look at life expectancy, Hawaiians live a good 10-15 years longer than people in those countries. So by every objective measure, they live a better life than they would have if they had stayed a monarchy.  
  
I don't care for the ethnocentric, nativist, nationalistic conservative mindset either. Hawaii is great because of the diversity of people that came to the island. If Hawaii were to be its own sovereign nation and return to a monarchy, and then kicked out all the white, Japanese, Filipinos, etc., Hawaii would not be better off.

Hawaiians are around $65k GDP per capita, where as Fiji is $6k, Samoa is around $5k, Tonga is under $5k. Comparing to other pacific island countries Hawaii has benefitted from infrastructure, education and healthcare.   Because it is a US state, it has benefitted in tourism and as trading hub.

Shouldn't you be more critical of the institutional policies, the school administration, and yourselves as teachers?  
  
I became an accidental homeschooling parent this school year. We're going through an online charter school, but it's still homeschooling. The experience made me appreciate the really good teachers and be critical of m'eh teachers and attitudes some hold.  
  
If you're interested, [here were the options, decision-making, and teaching strategies towards homeschooling](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eprEu49Ov_7N0V7GUPKiD9lKkP5NlDH41a8AKKCFCQY/edit?usp=sharing).  
  
There are hundreds of posts like this that complain about students, social media, and phones. I'm not arguing that kids should have access to social media or have phones. I'm just pointing out that it's not common to hear about a teacher taking key lessons from social media or how teachers are leveraging the phone as tools for learning. Some of the most popular TikTok videos are 'how-to' and 'explainer' videos. Instead of teachers learning what makes a 'how-to' video great, teachers would rather complain about how students have short attention spans. As adults, I would wager that most typically upskill and learn new subjects through watching YouTube, rather than taking full Coursera classes or university extension courses.  
  
I'm also very critical of schools for not creating incentives and connecting good students to struggling students for tutoring. I'm critical of schools and teachers for not adopting AI for personalized learning for students. For my daughter, I have very clear OKRs set for myself regarding my commitment to teaching her and also her hired tutor has OKRs. Parents don't see anything like that from teachers. I think this is why some Karens complaints are justified. This then leads to interest in homeschooling.","{""2024-05-04T23:33:22"":0}",false,

- caregiving (shelter, nutrition, exercise, sleep)

- communicate love

- teaching (knowledge, skills, behavior/habits)

If you do these 3 areas well, you're a good parent.  If you are negilent in any area- then you're probably not a good parent.   This is universally true to any race or gender or sexual orientation of the parent and any difference of the child.   In Chandler's clip-- you can tell he does all 3 areas covered very well.   

In terms- of addressing different race.   The best thing he can do for his kid (adopted or not, black or other) is teaching self acceptance, self confidence and teaching to stand for oneself and others.   Given on what Chandler said and his background-- it's pretty clear that he excels in this area as well.  

I was born in the US, but my parents were Vietnam war refugees.  Then later on- my parents divorced and my mom married a white guy.

Jews who came to Palestine, first from Russia and later from elsewhere, generally fit the accepted definition of refugees who were escaping persecution (at least 80 percent of them by my calculation). In no sense (despite Turkish suspicions) did they represent Russian interests. They sought rather to leave their proverbial Diaspora baggage behind and build a new society based on ancient Middle Eastern roots, including a revived Semitic language.

Secondly, unlike the classical colonialist powers (such as France or Great Britain), Jewish settlers did not include the existing population in their basic design, except as incidental beneficiaries. The presence of another people was first and foremost a major inconvenience, which the early Zionists tried their best to ignore and minimalize, not to dominate or reshape. They did not recognize the Arab population of Palestine as another people with their own collective claims, arguing that as individuals Arabs would benefit from the progress that Jewish settlement would bring”

However, contemporaneous positions generally advanced towards equating sexuality with passion, and although they were still not hostile to sexual relationships by themselves, they nonetheless believed those should be limited in order to retain self-control.[^(\[50\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-Comp-50)[^(\[52\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-Same-52) Musonius espoused the only natural kind of sex was that meant for [procreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procreation), defending a companionate form of marriage between man and woman,[^(\[50\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-Comp-50) and considered relationships solely undergone for pleasure or affection as unnatural.[^(\[52\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-Same-52)","{""2024-05-04T23:35:58"":1}",false,

Since stoicism isn't a dogma (something I'd argue is the main problem with any religion, making it inflexible), there is no singular stance on sexuality outside of how the 4 virtues could be applied to it, primarily in this case, self control. There aren't any extant writings from Stoic philosophers even discussing homosexuality, so we don't have anything to even point to in that regard.

In my mind it's not so much about the individual, (I have no doubt a genuine practice of Christian faith leads to a virtuous life), but the broader movement as a whole is harmed by the desire/need to force the virtues upon others.

Whenever it becomes about forcing virtues upon others, often through violent and compulsory methods, it comes at a cost of ones own virtues, and the faith overall.

You can't force virtues on anyone, no matter how you try. Someone can only obtain them if they actively seek to do so. It's a self-initiated striving to live up to ideals that are ultimately impossible to obtain fully, but the striving will make you a better person (and better contributor to society) as a result.

Also note that the Stoic virtues don't come with the baggage of moral laws related to sexuality that come out of ancient Hebrew tradition that ultimately have little to do with living virtuously. (Temperance does not involve sexual preference.)","{""2024-05-04T23:36:02"":1}",false,

Seems like you all are reacting to something that is not even there. If you can point to something not factual about what it said as an INFLUENCE, please do.

Are you inferring that Christianity was NOT influenced by Judaism in regard to monotheism, messianic expectations or the covenant? If so, how did these concepts get into Christianity in the first place?

You can (perhaps rightly) say that Early Christians misinterpreted many of these Jewish concepts and integrated them in a faulty manner into their own belief system, but that is still an influence.","{""2024-05-04T23:36:03"":-2}",false,

3. As far as we know, it was built using pre-existing proven methods, while there are some new ones in the pipeline. It's even a possibility that one of the new architectures will replace Transformers in the industry.
4. Open AI was slowly building their training data for many years now. Even GPT-3 was a very impressive model and it completely blew my mind in 2020.

To illustrate, one often gets better results doing something 2x cheaper in 2x more time.

>Why not? Doesn't process theism deny classical omnipotence? It's not just that God doesn't exert coercive influence, it's that God *cannot*. Denying omnipotence is one way of defeating the PoE.

For reasons I alluded to in my original post (Superman) and in my response above (culpable ignorance).  Process theology usually maintains that God is highly intelligent (understatement), beyond how people on r/singularity tend to view ASI. Or maybe not so beyond... they can get pretty carried away. However, the problem of presently occurring evils remains. Without delving into broader arguments, cf. a paper by Michael Sudduth on the supposed Boethian solution from around the early 2000s, if I recall correctly. If process theology aims to address the problem of presently occurring evils by expanding the scope of God's ignorance, it would have to do so to such a degree that God would start to resemble characters from Greek mythology or contemporary Marvel movies.

If a theist adopts a position like this, then I suppose that's fine. I'll grant that one can circumvent the POE by rejecting God's omnipotence or omnibenevolence, and you can at least mitigate the problem by denying God's omniscience. However, if someone is already a theist, I don't understand why those positions would be more plausible than the skeptical theist position, which would also transfer to some extent to the analogous POE in the context of the simulation hypothesis. If these hypothetical beings are so different from us and so much more advanced, then perhaps they have access to reasons that we cannot comprehend.

I'm grappling to find the right words to express this, so I'll borrow some ideas and language from nearby domains, hopefully without causing confusion. The appeal of simulation arguments that I'm familiar with have a 'future like ours' quality, to borrow a phrase from abortion debates. However, if we have to posit an unknown type of being that we can only describe apophatically, to borrow a term from theology, then it drifts into the realm of 'brain in a vat' scenarios that don't have much persuasive force.

Another point I would like to challenge is the notion that our hypothetical Simulators could be so advanced while simultaneously being so ignorant. I can accept the idea that advanced intelligence, of any kind, does not necessitate advanced morality (in fact, I hold to such a position). But I'm skeptical of the idea that advanced scientific intelligence could be so compartmentalized from imaginative, abstract, philosophical intelligence to such a degree that the Simulators wouldn't have investigated the possibility of our consciousness or been curious about this phenomenon we call pain, which was entirely unknown to them. Furthermore, if we stipulated that it was of interest to them, but they couldn't begin to comprehend it, this would paint a rather pessimistic picture of our own study of consciousness. It might even suggest that qualia like pain are irreducible and beyond the scope of scientific understanding.

The only support I have for this skepticism off-hand comes from an analogy to ourselves: we've only just scratched the surface in understanding stochastic parrots, yet long before that, we had been contemplating artificial consciousness. Someone could dismiss that skepticism by circling back to the apophatic stance, however. (As mentioned in another comment, I'm not primarily interested in securing a defeater for SH.)

Finally, I would question whether their immense ignorance gets them off the hook of being moral monsters. Without delving into broader arguments, I'll simply stipulate that sometimes our ignorance is culpable. I believe Simulators with the power and knowledge to create a world like ours would be culpably ignorant if they could be so unaware. It at least still seems rational to affirm this:

    1. The Simulators are evil (significantly less good than us).

At least so long as we don't take ""evil"" to require some feature like ""intentional sadism."" Though if one wanted to fight over that word choice, I'd be happy with this alternative:

Can you make a 4x4 word square, with 8 unique words and clues for each word to solve. Have 16 all unique letters in the grid too (so no repeat letters to get the vertical similar to horizontal words)!! Format the grid code blocks for good formatting. Be a professional word and logic puzzle creator, think through carefully and annotate and write out loud your thought process before making the grid (think carefully about number placement of the letters and write these down too so you can align them, using an x,y matrix of each position in the grid) so you can make sure all the letters align up properly for every single word.  After writing the grid look over it and make sure it's perfectly correct, if it is not then redo it and adjust if possible to correct. There should be 8 entirely different and unique words, 4 going horizontally and 4 going vertically and they should all be unique and different to find, all with different letters, you can check against this to make sure it is correct. All 8 words should all be completely real and valid English words (no abbreviations or names) with correct spelling.

Creating a 4x4 Word Square with Unique Clues

To create a 4x4 word square with unique letters and 8 different words (4 horizontal and 4 vertical), we need to carefully select words and place them thoughtfully. Each word must be exactly four letters long, and all 16 letters in the grid must be unique.

Step 1: Selecting Words

The challenge is finding words that fit these criteria:

* Exactly four letters
* No repeating letters across all words
* Must form valid words both horizontally and vertically

Given these constraints, let's brainstorm possible words. We need to find words that not only fit the length and uniqueness criteria but also intersect correctly to form other valid words.

Here's a list of candidate words (each contains unique letters):

* FLUX
* GIRD
* WANE
* HYPE

Step 2: Checking for Intersections

The next step is placing these words in a grid to ensure they intersect correctly without repeating any letters. Let's arrange them:

* FLUX
* GIRD
* WANE
* HYPE","{""2024-05-04T23:37:50"":1}",false,

I’m noticing that it seems to drop faster than it rises, especially if volatility is low, which makes it difficult.

I also assumed the opposite option would have the opposite movement (so if I get a short signal at 508.50 I could switch from say 509C to 508P). But I just recently realized the deltas seem to be lopsided, for example the puts don’t move as much as the calls, and therefore the put positions are not recovering you as fast as you might have dropped.

If you want to understand what current AIs are like, consider the part of your mind that just notices sensations and has a very fast response in guessing what sort of sensations they are. Like you feel roughness and your brain instantly guesses that you're touching tree bark, or you see an orange glow and your brain instantly guesses that you're looking at fire. Now imagine that that part of your mind is really good at what it does, but there's *nothing else* going on.

A lot of engineering work has gone into making nuclear reactors safe, and the newer models are *ridiculously* safe, you pretty much have to be an expert in nuclear engineering to have any chance of causing a meltdown.

But of course eventually even the idle reactors would be eroded by natural forces and their fuel would be exposed. Fortunately this isn't a big deal either. There isn't actually *that* much nuclear fuel in the power plants, and it's not radioactive enough to cause serious harm once it gets diluted into the natural environment. And, just because of different designs and environments, there'd be decades or centuries of difference in when various reactors eroded away and released their fuel, further decreasing the ecological impact at any one moment.

The other things humans have done to the Earth's ecosystem (air pollution, habitat destruction, vast amounts of physical infrastructure and agriculture, etc) would have way more effect on the future of life on Earth than the nuclear reactors would.

I'd suggest 'Are you single too?' because that way the focus is on him and you and your mutual availability rather than on his hypothetical girlfriend. Set things up as an opportunity, not a competition.

Other than that, I don't think you need to open that strong anyway, it's fine to strike up a conversation first. With the right conversation you can probably figure out whether someone is taken before very long.

In any case I don't drink alcohol or go to bars so I'm not sure my advice applies to the kinds of guys who *do* drink alcohol and go to bars. Just a disclaimer there.

>using this anywhere where people aren’t drunk would be really weird for them and too forward.

I recommend just starting a conversation first, and getting the topic around to their (and your) single/taken status in a natural way. Any guy who's interested is probably going to be happy with the opportunity to have a conversation with you in the first place and you won't have any trouble keeping his attention. Taking your time also helps to establish trust and make it more clear that you're not suspicious.","{""2024-05-04T23:38:33"":1}",false,

I suspect it won't be unemployment numbers as such that go down, but rather wages and working hours will drop off and people will be doing more unstable gig work for less pay (more of which will go towards housing).

>I hear the AI CEOs saying -- but not seeming to believe, themselves -- that new jobs for the new world will keep workers employed.

They may actually believe it, but of course it's nonsense. Remember that they're not average people and their attitudes are informed by their highly non-average experience of life and work. It's easy for self-made millionaires to believe in a meritocracy that largely doesn't exist.

Because it would need to be done forcibly. Money is a natural outcome when people want to trade stuff and want a way of abstractly measuring the amount of stuff they're trading. You would need to interfere with people's freedom to produce and trade in order to ensure that they *don't* use money. Interfering with people's freedom is the real problem; how do you justify that? In general you need a pretty good justification for that.

>Before money was thing the world was more peaceful, less violent and it was debtless.

No, it really, *really* wasn't. Murder rates in every pre-modern society were astronomically higher than they are now. Debts may not have had numbers associated with them, but the notion of enacting revenge or extracting payment from someone else has been baked into our psychology since before humans existed. Indeed, debts that aren't measured with numbers are *worse* for society because no one can tell when they've been paid off and people tend to extract more than they were owed.

You seem to have an unrealistic fantasy notion of what ancient societies were like. I'm not sure where you got that from but it's utterly wrong.

In ancient societies, pretty much everyone was in poverty.

By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine. Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language. A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.

What I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's. These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning. They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions. The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way. No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.

I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter, the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory. I believe the extended TNGS is that theory. My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public. And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.

My advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly.

* Slippery Slope: ""This type of technology has the potential to be highly disruptive and could be used to manipulate public opinion or create propaganda.""
* Appeal to Ignorance: ""Ultimately, the impact of generative AI art on society and culture will depend on how it is used and embraced by the wider community.""
* Red Herring: ""Is the concept of individual style still relevant in the age of generative AI art?""
* Hasty Generalization: ""At its most basic, generative AI art is the art that is created using algorithms or machine learning techniques.""
* Non Sequitur: ""This can take many different forms, from paintings and drawings to music and even poetry.""
* False Analogy: ""One of the earliest examples of generative AI art is “AARON,” a program developed in the 1970s by artist Harold Cohen, AARON was designed to generate original works of art in the form of drawings and paintings, and Cohen used it to create thousands of works over the course of his career.""
* Straw Man: ""Some have raised concerns about the potential for AI algorithms to do harm or be used for nefarious purposes.""
* Circular Reasoning: ""It is often thought that this individual style is an inherent part of an artist’s identity and is the result of their personal experiences, influences, and creative vision.""
* Ad Hominem: ""The emergence of generative AI art has led some to question the validity of this idea.""
* Bandwagon: ""As the capabilities of generative AI art continue to improve, the question of how it will impact the art world and society as a whole becomes increasingly pressing.""
* False Cause: ""The history of generative AI art can be traced back to the early days of artificial intelligence research.""
* Begging the Question: ""As generative AI art continues to evolve and become more prevalent, it is important to consider the ethical implications of its use.""
* Equivocation: ""Some believe that generative AI art will simply complement and enhance traditional forms of art, rather than replace human artists altogether.""

Other than that - yes, suffering is inherent to human life due to all the fears, wants and not-wants that human beings fall prey to. The social conditioning of „nothing is ever enough“ is something that our economy is build upon, too. You are forced to buy into it or you don’t get fed. You have seen through it at a very young age which is pretty cool. 

Somehow I think that reading (or listening to) Alan Watts talks would be of use to you in the moment. If you haven’t already found him, that is. His approach to the „awakening topics“ is playful and light-hearted (also suitable for atheists and theists alike, despite him having been a Christian theologian at some point in his life, and yes I say it as someone who has never been a Christian) and this might be good in times when the world seems bleak. 

But back to the more worldly aspect for a moment: have you considered that maybe it’s engineering that was not the type of science that you enjoy? What about theoretical or quantum physics or mathematics, or neuroscience? With your strong wish to understand what’s behind all that happens, you might excel at those too and they might be less „grind“  and „material practicality“ than engineering is. And it would still enable a living of some kind after finishing. Because if you have the ability to learn efficiently, why not use it?

 For most concept artists that starting 10% of concept art that you are replacing with AI is the reason they became concept artists. Its super fun to problemsolve, see what makes sense and doesnt and come up with unique concepts. The rest is refining and rendering which is kinda tidious. 

If you told a 100 concept artists that they have to choose between coming up with the intial concept art and then using AI to render and then they add the final details or the AI come up with initial art and then they render and finish the work 90 of them would chose the former and you would have saved up time and money since 80% of time goes into rendering. Some of them would even choose to do the concept art for free if given a choise between bringing to life AI art or spending more time to create their own stuff out of some mood board you made on pinterest. I certainly would for a project that sounds fun.

&#x200B;

I appreciate the concerns raised in the post about the use of AI in art and the potential impact on human creativity and expression. However, I believe that many of the points mentioned are rooted in capitalist ideologies and the exploitation of informational gatekeeping in the art world.

&#x200B;

First, the idea that AI art poses a threat to human employment in the creative industries is not necessarily true. As with any technological advancement, there will be shifts in the job market and new opportunities will arise. Instead of fearing AI, we should embrace it as a tool that can enhance and augment human creativity, rather than replace it.

&#x200B;

Second, the issue of authorship and ownership of AI-generated art raises important questions about control and ownership of information. However, this is not a new problem in the art world, as issues of authenticity and originality have always been contested. The question of authorship and ownership should be approached with an understanding that art is a collective cultural product and not something that can be owned by an individual or group.

&#x200B;

Another important point to consider is that the resistance to AI art may be driven by the fear of losing value in the information gatekeeping. If we strip away the capitalist elements and the financial incentives, would we still want to stifle the potential of AI art?

&#x200B;

Lastly, I would like to remind you that AI art is also a product of human creativity, both in its training data and the programming itself. Therefore, AI art is also art, and we should not disregard it as something that is less valuable or less worthy of recognition.

&#x200B;

What makes human creativity so special and unique is its ability to adapt and evolve with new technologies and tools. We should strive to create something truly unique and original that reflects the collective human experience.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I believe that instead of fearing AI, we should embrace it as a tool for enhancing human creativity and expression. Let us question the capitalist ideologies that drive the exploitation of information gatekeeping in the art world and strive to create something truly unique and original.","{""2024-05-04T23:42:12"":2}",false,

Firstly, it is important to recognize that the protection of an artist's rights over their work is rooted in capitalism and the ability to exploit the output of the artist. Outside of economic exploitation, artists have little say in the relationship a consumer has with their art, as the meaning of the work exists between the viewer and the object, not because of the creator.  
  
Once a work is published and made available for public consumption, the artist loses control over the idea or creation as it begins to occupy the minds of those who view it. In this way, AI and human artists create in a similar fashion, absorbing the zeitgeist of the art around them and synthesizing new works. Everything is a remix.  
  
It's also worth noting that the statement ""Art is already democratized. Just learn how to fucking do it"" is a pretty lazy response. It doesn't account for all of the ways that we benefit from technology and tools. For example, you can't make your own computer mouse, or paint, or even make your own paint brush. We need these tools to level the playing field and make it possible for people with ideas to express them without having to jump the arbitrary hurdle of having done the thing for x number of hours. The point of art for a lot of people is to communicate an idea, not to be the best at painting with a 1 hair brush.   
AI art generation can also help level the creative output for people who are otherwise disabled by providing them with tools and technologies that allow them to express their ideas and create art in ways that may not have been possible before.  
  
In conclusion, while I understand the concerns of artists regarding AI, I believe that it is important to recognize the potential benefits that AI can bring to the art world, and to find ways to balance the protection of artist's rights with the democratization of art through technology.","{""2024-05-04T23:42:14"":1}",false,
j470zod,10563hj,artstation,t3_10563hj,v73232zr,2023-01-13 17:43:24+00,"Dear fellow artists,  
  
I appreciate the concerns raised in the post about the use of AI in art and the potential impact on human creativity and expression. However, I believe that many of the points mentioned are rooted in capitalist ideologies and the exploitation of informational gatekeeping in the art world.  
  
First, the idea that AI art poses a threat to human employment in the creative industries is not necessarily true. As with any technological advancement, there will be shifts in the job market and new opportunities will arise. Instead of fearing AI, we should embrace it as a tool that can enhance and augment human creativity, rather than replace it.  
  
Second, the issue of authorship and ownership of AI-generated art raises important questions about control and ownership of information. However, this is not a new problem in the art world, as issues of authenticity and originality have always been contested. The question of authorship and ownership should be approached with an understanding that art is a collective cultural product and not something that can be owned by an individual or group.  
  
Another important point to consider is that the resistance to AI art may be driven by the fear of losing value in the information gatekeeping. If we strip away the capitalist elements and the financial incentives, would we still want to stifle the potential of AI art?  
  
Lastly, I would like to remind you that AI art is also a product of human creativity, both in its training data and the programming itself. Therefore, AI art is also art, and we should not disregard it as something that is less valuable or less worthy of recognition.  
What makes human creativity so special and unique is its ability to adapt and evolve with new technologies and tools. We should strive to create something truly unique and original that reflects the collective human experience.  
  
In conclusion, I believe that instead of fearing AI, we should embrace it as a tool for enhancing human creativity and expression. Let us question the capitalist ideologies that drive the exploitation of information gatekeeping in the art world and strive to create something truly unique and original.","{""2024-05-04T23:42:15"":1}",false,

Artists with strong fundamentals who understand theory and composition and work with AI tools will be well-positioned to take advantage of these new tools and create some amazing digital assets and commercial art, but it's also important to recognize that AI can democratize the art world and make it more accessible to a wider range of people. And you know what? That's a great thing! More people making art means more art to enjoy!  
  
If we stop worrying about how to exploit the work and just focus on making cool art, we'll be a lot happier. It's important to approach the conversation around AI and the art world with an open mind and a willingness to consider multiple perspectives, as the future of the art industry is not about AI replacing human artists, but rather about how we can use AI to enhance human creativity and open new opportunities.

The approaches, the lessons learned, the experiences of the individual artist's have seen that craft mature and evolve over time, but every single person is unique. The idea of style being a myth belies a fundamental ignorance of the craft of painting and drawing. Styles exist, styles are legitimate and styles are the product of an individual's own subjective approach to the CRAFT of painting and drawing. EVERY PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS STYLE IS UNIQUE - and more importantly, with someone who actually knows what the fuck they are talking about - they can be identified fairly easily. In fact, most professional artists rely on their own style as a product that they sell. People come to them for their individual style.

In fact you can ask a professional artist to copy or steal another artists style, to imitate it and they will - this is where we get forgeries from - something that is considered a crime. You can ask artists to emulate the styles of a certain era and they can and will. That doesn't mean it is THEIR STYLE, it just means you've asked them to turn their hand at something they can do because of their training for a specific outcome - but the individual artist doesn't apply their craft in that way on their own work. In fact asking them to do that might even influence their own style as they learn new things and combine new things.

There is. What's more - there is no such thing as an AI style. The AI will only output what it has access to in terms of training data. There are no experiences outside of the training data that can add to the result. The training data is the result. For humans EVERYTHING is training data. Not just the images they see, but the emotions they experience, whether they woke up on the wrong side of the bed that day, what they had for breakfast and the point of this isn't to express some philosophically point about humans and how special we are, but to explain how and why style emerges naturally. AI style doesn't exist because there is nothing outside of the bucket of images it is trained on to result in anything emergent.

>""OK cool so the only difference is that people can create new emergent results that don't rely on image based training?"" Yes - and it influences their style. Maybe they are lazy and they become looser in their approach.

What AI could do, potentially, is simply add another layer of randomization in the output so as to provide unexpected stylistic results - but fundamentally it was based on a human product. One that was built over decades of training and life experience. And if that person was a professional, it is very likely, if not a certainty, that their style is a product they rely on. It is one they crafted themselves over time. Something that emerged and resulted in something unique to them.

I understand the concern that AI may replace human artists and devalue the time and effort invested in honing one's craft. However, it's important to recognize that this pushback against AI in the art world may be rooted in information gatekeeping and a fear of change.  
  
It's also important to consider the role of capitalism in this debate. The focus on protecting art as a commodity rather than a form of expression is limiting the potential for new and innovative forms of art that AI can bring to the world. Additionally, the pushback against AI may be rooted in pride and a sense of ownership over a certain style or approach to art.  
  
We must remember that throughout history, there have been other forms of automation and technology that have impacted traditional crafts, such as the printing press and calligraphy. Instead of viewing these technologies as a threat to traditional art forms and artists, we should see how they can be adopted and adapted to enhance and evolve the art world. AI can lead to the creation of new forms of art, new techniques, and a new way to see the world.  
  
It's also worth noting that AI can democratize the art world by making it possible for anyone to make tool-assisted art. This can remove many painful barriers to entry and make it easier for people to create. With AI, the creative effort is made easier and more accessible to everyone. This is a wonderful thing that can bring more people to the art world and make it more diverse.  
  
It's important to approach the conversation around AI and the art world with an open mind and a willingness to consider multiple perspectives. Let's not let the fear of the unknown cloud our judgment, but rather embrace the opportunities that AI can bring to the art industry. It's time to evolve and embrace the future of art.","{""2024-05-04T23:42:16"":1}",false,

A brain death I imagine would feel exactly like you felt before you were born, or in other words, you wouldn't feel anything. Sleep, even if your brain doesn't completely turn itself off, has the same effect. Your consciousness is shut off.

I think the correct way to think about this is that the brain is just the hardware you're running on. It is absurd to claim a program copied from one harddrive to another dies in the process, you just moved it over by slowly deleting the old one. Your consciousness will just emerge wherever the information that makes you up is.

Your concerns seem to arise from the fallacies I describes earlier. For one, the idea that there is an unchanging 'you' which you associate your sense of self with ampliphied by your subjective experiences up to now, and the unreasonable fear of death that you think you'd lose something in the process that is not retrievable.

Like let me ask you, what is it that is being preserved but disappears during death? If you answer this with some metaphysical concepts and ideas, there's not much we can discuss, that falls outside of the domain of science.

The only physically correct answer I can think of is that there is nothing disappearing, you are the information that makes you up, and can be 'revived' as long as it's not too corrupted.

I disagree with this notion, it isn't obvious at all.

Most people point out the seemingly paradox situation of there being 2 you's when you copy yourself over. 

As far as I could tell, you're nothing more than the information you consist of, and at the time of copying, both are equivalent. At least for the brief moment until they diverge from each other. Now which one of the copies is 'you'? Who is 'you', what is 'you'? In my opinion, it's just an illusion, an emergent illusion arising from your collective information. There is no 'you'. Or in other words, the copy is equally 'you' as you are.

>As long as the machine of information that is your consciousness is never interrupted I believe one would survive that transition.

This here's the issue in your thinking imo. What about sleep? A coma. Or when someone knocks you out. There are many cases in which someones consciousness gets interrupted. In fact, everyone experiences it, daily. And yet you wouldn't consider that dying, right? Or if you do, 'dying' would need an entirely different definition.

The idea that there's a singular unchanging 'you' is just a fallacy. Let's think of the instant of the copying again. There is now 2 identical 'you''s. But both of you are in different situations, and will diverge the moment you start thinking. Then when you look around and you'll rejoice. YES, IT WORKED, you'll think. The only issue is that there's still another 'you' which is in the old body. You'll think oh no, I'm still trapped in this body. 

The fallacy in your thinking is that you expect to move from one body to another to keep your sense of identity, which simply isn't the case. It's comparabale to copying a program running on a computer to another computer. Both programs are equal at that moment, but if you run them both, they soon won't be exact copies any more. Obviously in this case if you don't want your data to be split on 2 computers, you wouldn't run the program on the old computer any more. 

It's no different with you. Like I said, it's an illusion. If you don't wake up, there won't be anyone to experience it. The only experience will be the waking-up-in-your-new-body experience, experienced by you. And this isn't anything new. This exact thing happens to you every night. The difference is just that up to now, you always woke up in the same body, which gave you the wrong impression that you are trapped inside your body, and that the only escape would be to observe yourself escaping, when that's not necessary.

Now, consider the set of all DTMs with an input alphabet Σ = {#,0,1} where # is the symbol for blank, and two halt states H = {h\_yes ,h\_no}.So the transition function δ: {Q-H} × Σ ➜ Q × ({🠔, ➝} ∪ Σ) of any such DTM can be thought of as a finite table with (|Q|-2) \*|Σ| rows and 4 columns for the current state, symbol under the head, next state and the action. 

&#x200B;

We can encode the entire transition function using only positive integers by assigning each state and symbol positive integers. Integers j > 0 and k > 0 correspond to elements of Q and Σ where j = 1, 2 correspond to the halt states h\_yes and h\_no and k = 3, ..., |S|+2 correspond to the inputs in Σ. (1 and 2 are reserved for 🠔 and ➝). Thus we can represent every row with 4 integers i, j, k and m. 

&#x200B;

We can encode this using only 0's and 1's, by simply using 1's as separators and using the amount of 0's to represent the integers i, j, k and m, which would look like this: row r = 10^(i)10^(j)10^(k)10^(m) and the entire transition function can be encoded by simply concatenating all rows. Thus every DTM corresponds to a binary string.

&#x200B;

Next let L be the language corresponding to any legitimate encoding of the transition function of a DTM with binary inputs as described above, and for each w ∈ L the unique DTM Mcan be written as a function of the string w as M = M(w). We extend the encoding of a DTM M like this: a string u ∈ {0,1}\* is said to be ""accepted"" if M eventually halts at its legitimate halt state h\_yes starting from the initial string u on its tape. And if w ∈ {0,1}\* \~ L we let M(w) = R, which is a DTM which moves to the right all the time.

&#x200B;

Now comes the important part, we define a diagonal language D ∈ {0,1}\* as D := (w ∈ {0,1}\* | M(w) accepts w) and thus it's complenent D^(c) := (w ∈ {0,1}\* | M(w) does not accept w)

&#x200B;

The key question here is, is there a DTM that semidecides (accept) the language D^(c)? And the answer is NO! Why not, you may ask. Let's suppose there is a DTM M\* that semidecides D^(c). Let u\* be a binary encoding of M\* in L so that M(u\*) = M\*. What happens if we try putting u\* as an input into M(u\*)?

&#x200B;

First note that there's only 2 possibilities, either u\* ∈ D^(c) or u\* ∈ D.

&#x200B;

Case 1, u\* ∈ D^(c) : M\* accepts u\* because M\* semidecides D^(c) and u\* ∈ D^(c). But from the definition of D^(c) it follows that M\* does not accept u\*. There's a logical contradiction, it's not possible!

&#x200B;

Case 2, u\* ∈ D : M\* does not accept u\* because M\* semidecides D^(c) and and u ∈ D. But M\* also has to accept u\* following the definition of D^(c) and u ∈ D... another logical contradiction: not possible!

&#x200B;

A logical contradiction is the end of rational thought, hence no such DTM M\* encoded by u\* exists.

&#x200B;

But is there a DTM M that decides D? The answer to this question too is no. Why? Let's suppose it does, then for a DTM M' which is the same as M except h\_yes and h\_no are interchanged then M' would have to decide D^(c). But this contradicts the previous result since D^(c) is not even semidecidable. 

&#x200B;

But if D is not decidable then H₀ is not decidable either, where H₀ = (u ∈ {0,1}\*; {0,1}\* | u=(u₁;u₂); M=M(u₁) and M halts on u₂) because D is the special case for H₀ with u₁ = u₂.

&#x200B;

The point is, not everything is computable. There are problems that can NEVER be solved by computers, either because of fundamental flaws in math and logic as in this example, or because the computational ressources would exceed what's available in the (observable) universe, such as the travelling salesman problem.","{""2024-05-04T23:42:44"":10}",false,

It is not like your bullet example, because the wave part is definitely somehow fundamental.  For instance, in the double-slit experiment we see the wave nature of photons influencing where the photon hits the screen, in a way that is impossible to replicate with just a particle.  The wave is not an emission or side effect of the particle, it is somehow inherently tied to the photon in a way that effects its properties.

This is exemplified by the math that describes photons (and all particles) behavior.  While a particle is relatively isolated, it follows the Schroedinger equation which is a linear wave equation.  However, when it interacts with a large system, like an experimental detector, then it appears to ""collapse"" to a single point like a particle.

There are a few ways to reconcile this, we don't know which if any of them are true.  Theories like many worlds posit that light is *always* a wave and the appearance of particle-like behavior is a side effect of us being macro scale beings that can only see a small part (one branch) of the wave function at a time.  So when the photons interact with us, they look like particles.

On the other hand, there theories like DeBroglie-Bohm pilot waves where the photon exists as a real physical particle but it also has a paired wave function that moves through space and tells the particle where to go.

Finally, there are other theories that just give up on trying to figure it out and say hey, we have math that works well enough to predict experiment results, who cares what is actually going on underneath that and/or maybe it is impossible for us to ever know.","{""2024-05-04T23:44:28"":1}",false,

Duly noted, with brevity I wanted to state a relevant point: I think I have a really, really severe anxiety disorder, and I think my deteriorating physical and emotional health has basically caused this cycle to continue.. because I cannot just ""be"" anymore - or ""Viva la Vida"" - my prior modus operandi. 

-------------------

I think a lot of my time is actually preoccupied with ruminating about how much irreparable damage this last year of severe insomnia has caused me. I read that with OCD the worst thing you can possibly do is try to suppress the obsessive thoughts, and, I find almost 24/7 I am desperately trying to suppress those emotions that I am just going further and further downhill, looking sicker and sicker, losing more and more of myself, etc... i honestly don't think i can handle this myself anymore.. maybe i can still make tiny improvements, but it is so, so hard, especially when the emotional turmoil is combined with insomnia, extreme pain, and serious medical issues all the time.

i should really stop enabling this behavior by visiting forums like this, or googling stuff

what i am trying to say... is that i genuinely need like serious help i think. i have always been a very independent person but i am stuck in a very dark cycle and i sometimes pull out a little bit but once the extreme pain returns [for example by eating, or getting upset, etc] then i get destabilized again.

***anyway***, ***i am doing it again***. i know that in moments of clarity [hard to come by] that my uniform priority is justifiably on controlling the chronic stress.. and those are the moments i feel my best, feel like i might be able to make it out of this. so i should read that book you are suggesting, and maybe that YouTube channel too if they emphasize psychological health - esp. in the context of being in really bad situations.","{""2024-05-04T23:48:15"":1}",true,

Electrical and computer engineering graduate student Michael Tomlinson and undergraduate Joe Li—both members of the Andreou Lab—used natural language prompts and ChatGPT4 to produce detailed instructions to build a spiking neural network chip: one that operates much like the human brain.

Through step-by-step prompts to ChatGPT4, starting with mimicking a single biological neuron and then linking more to form a network, they generated a full chip design that could be fabricated.

""This is the first AI chip that is designed by a machine using natural language processing. It is similar to us telling the computer 'Make an AI neural network chip' and the computer spits out a file used to manufacture the chip,"" said Andreas Andreou, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, co-founder of the Center for Language and Speech Processing and member of the Kavli Neuroscience Discovery Institute and Johns Hopkins new Data Science and AI Institute.","{""2024-05-04T23:50:01"":19}",false,

In a press conference, company CEO Zhang Wei revealed they have created an innovative new power source that combines nickel-63 isotope decay and China’s first diamond semiconductor module. This integration allows the battery to be dramatically miniaturized while maintaining low production costs.

At just 15x15x5 mm, smaller than a coin, the BB100 battery produces 100 microwatts of energy safely and stably for 50 years without recharging. The nuclear battery generates power every second and minute, producing 8.64 joules of energy per day and 3,153 joules of energy per year. The modular design means multiple batteries can be connected to deliver higher output. The stable, zero-emission energy could help power AI and autonomous technologies driving China’s next revolution.

At its core is the company’s unique ability to dope diamond, the holy grail of semiconductors, into large wafers only 10 micrometers thin. This enables the radioactive nickel to efficiently convert its decay into electricity. It has entered the pilot production stage and will soon be mass produced and released on the market.

If it's moving properly inside of the unity editor then my guess would be that it's an issue with how the avatar is setup for vrchat.  
Might be quickest to just start a new project from scratch and reimport the model just to make sure you didn't miss something during setup.  


Potentially (and this is a stretch) could still be an issue with the rig depending how it was setup, although I kind of doubt it.  
It is possible that the rig has multiple skeletons/armatures which is something that  is useful for animation purposes, especially if the rig was made using some sort of automated process.  
To put it simply, there could be 2 skeletons, one that deforms the mesh, which is the one we want, and the other that doesn't really do anything outside of Blender.

  
So I guess it could be technically possible that the model has two skeletons and when you tested the movement in Unity you selected the correct skeleton, but maybe the animator itself is connected to the skeleton that doesn't do anything which would result in the T-posing.  
Should be easy to tell by looking in the outliner in the unity editor if there's a duplicate skeleton.

First is the lack of volume in the cheeks.  
This is pretty normal when modeling using a front and side view.  
It's something you have to account for and tweak manually.  


Second is the shape of the eyes.  
While anime eyes in 3D usually don't use spheres, the overall shape of the eye should still be more or less spherical.  
What I think went wrong is that you assumed that the inner edge of the eye (closest to the nose) in the front view is what you were seeing in the side view and just mapped those points, That kind of gives this flat, wall-eyed effect where the iris doesn't really sit well in the eye cavity.  
What you're really seeing in the side view is just the side of the eye that's curved towards us.  
That inner edge is curved away from us in a profile view and hidden behind the curvature of the eye.  


The curvature of the eye is not always super obvious in some styles, many artists just kind of imply it, but here's an example where it is obvious.

Inne spoleczenstwa byly duzo bardziej otwarte na migracje, a jednak teraz pojawiaja sie coraz czesciej glosy, ze byl to zly wybor.

I ludzie to widza. Widza tez, ze mniejszosci/imigrantow jest tez duzo mniej i sobie przypisuja korelacje (czy slusznie to juz inna kwestia).

Odnosnie kultury jeszcze - nie wszystkie kultury sa ze soba komptatybilne. Europejskie podejscie to luzniejszych obyczajow nie podoba sie w kulturze Islamu. A w druga strone - nam nie podoba sie w jaki sposob Islam traktuje kobiety, homoseksualizm itp.

My tego u siebie nie widzimy, ale w krajach gdzie Islam staje sie coraz wieksza czescia - to coraz czesciej dochodzi do starc w tych obszarach.

Dlatego duzo latwiej wciagnac kilka milionow Ukraincow niz kilka milionow osob z krajow islamskich.

Ale jak zaczna masowo do nas cisnac to jedyne co nas uratuje to chyba mury na granicach. Nie wyobrazam sobie wciagnac do naszego kraju kilkudziesieciu milionow ludzi (wiadomo, ze wieksza czesc bedzie chciala migrowac dalej a nie zatrzymac sie u nas, ale tak czy siak - bedziemy pierwsza stacja). 

Dlatego z jednej strony trzeba pracowac nad ulepszeniami praw migracyjnych, ale z drugiej strony mocno betonowac granice.

> Wiem ze jesli nawet stosunkowo liberalne srodowiska jak np ten sub nie popieraja tego to raczej nie wrozy dobrze dla dobra migrantow jednak jakiekolwiek badania spoleczne sa po mojej stronie.

To jest ten fragment, do ktorego bede chcial sie w wiekszosci odniesc, ale zanim to zrobie to maly backstory. W roznych politycznych kompasach wychodzi mi zasadniczo centrum z lekkim odchyleniem w lewo. Nie uwazam sie ani za lewicowca ani za prawicowca mimo, ze pewnie popieram wiecej kwestii lewicowych, to pewne rzeczy konserwatywne tez sa dla mnie wazne.

Moim zdaniem problem migracyjny jest bardzo zlozonym problemem. Serce mowi, ze chcialoby sie przyjac kazdego kto by chcial do nas zawitac, ale rozum sie na to nie zgadza.

* Dla Polakow jest bardzo wazna tozsamosc kulturowa. Z tego powodu nie mozna przyjac zbyt wielu migrantow o odrebnej kulturze bo zaczna sie zmiany kulturowe, ktorych Polacy sobie nie zycza. Nie zycza juz sobie ich teraz a daleko nam do takiego postepu migracyjnego jakie zrobily Belgia czy kraje skandynawskie.
* Nie mozna tez wpuszczac bez ograniczen. Tak jak sie uczy w przypadku awarii samolotu - najpierw trzeba sobie zalozyc maske tlenowa a dopiero potem dziecku. Nalezy przyjmowac tylu migrantow by sie nie zalamaly istniejace infrastruktury panstwowe (mieszkaniowe, pracowe itp itd). Nie wchodze w szczegoly bo to nie mi ustalac limity, ale podajac wyolbrzymiony przyklad - Polska nie jest w stanie przyjac 10-15 mln migrantow (a ile moze? nie mam pojecia)

Mimo tego co napisalem - zdaje sobie sprawe, ze to co sie dzieje na granicy z Bialorusia jest zalatwiane w bardzo zly sposob (filmy typu Zielona Granica na pewno pomagaja na swiadomosc) - to wymaga naprawy, ale nie na zasadzie ""wpuszczamy kogo popadnie"".

Wiadomo, ze wojna w Ukrainie to szczegolny przypadek. Wydaje mi sie, ze Polacy zareagowali dobrze (na pewno duzo lepiej niz nieprzygotowany rzad).

Natomiast to jest dopiero poczatek. Za kilka - kilkanascie lat bedzie masowa migracja ludzi z Afryki (przez masowa mam na mysli miliony) oraz czesci Azji. Na to nie jestesmy w zupelnosci przygotowani i lepiej wlasnie, zeby jakies prawa byly juz przygotowywane bo inaczej bedzie kompletny chaos.

> ten sub nie popieraja tego to raczej nie wrozy dobrze dla dobra migrantow

Bo jak przychodzi co do czego to najpierw sie mysli o swoich najblizszych, potem o sasiadach, potem o rodakach a dopiero potem o ludziach z zewnatrz.

The problem is that the ""art world"" is being conflated with the average day to day commercial artist.

It's the latter who are being screwed.

⚫ GPT-4, unless it comes out this year. Rumors about its capabilities and architecture have been so widespread that I have no idea what to expect from it, but the part where I am sure is that it is coming.

⚫ Publicly available text-to-image models conditional on embeds from a good text encoder and not CLIP (or, using the eDiff-I example, not just CLIP). We will collectively realize just how frustratingly vague and gist-based our current text-to-image models really were.

⚫ The H100 van brrr. 2-3x cost reductions on workloads doing anything the A100s were already good at, more if you can use things like fp8, with corresponding improvements to AI services.

⚫ Something crazy is going to happen in BioML that no one can agree on whether it's a huge breakthrough or a small increment.

...and some low-confidence spices:

⚫ Some cool architectural improvements on the diffusion models turn out to work really well and make them significantly cheaper, I don't know what. pyramid diffusion? Maybe someone figures out how to do the StyleGAN3 equivalences on a U-Net? Perhaps some trick that is particularly good for video?

⚫ Anyone figure out how to make text to image use references competently when drawing, without the crazy overfitting issues of textual inversion.

⚫ One of the big labs gets an LLM to usefully critique and correct their own chain of thought reasoning, it increases MMLU results by a scary number in the 5-10% range. (Bonus points if that applies to Codegen as well)

⚫ Someone trains a TTS to use T5 embeds, and suddenly he gets the right emotional prosody because he actually has an idea of ​​what he's saying.

I think, as with a lot of new technologies, following years will upstage this year's progress so that in retrospect this year in particular feels less significant. Like the early days of the internet. The internet itself has been a major foundational technology, but most people probably don't remember the first year it was introduced as a time of great significance relative to what it became in the following years. If in several years time AI has revolutionised medical science and we all have AI assistants with humanlike intelligence, coding is obsolete and anyone can make a game just by telling the AI what to do, etc, most people will probably barely remember the days when people who playing around with basic image generators. Even now, the image generators I was using months ago that couldn't manage humans at all feel like a distant memory compared to what I can do now.

***More money than ever has been invested in AI and I have never seen growth like this before. There is no reason for it to just slow down, however there is no reason for AI to progress at a faster rate next year***

The only thing I do know is, that 2023 will be crazy

One year ago I would have called you a deluded optimist, but now I don't know anymore just seeing the rapid advancement of AI of this year alone feels like it would have taken 5-10 years if it was in 2005.

Those 2027 predictions aren't looking too far off right now.

I can't even imagine where we will be in 5-10 years

***only the difference between the year 2000 and the year 2022 is extraordinary. I'm not sure you can really round to the nearest thousand***

It is crazy how many people basically saying, ""Nothing extraordinary has happened in the past twenty years or so. Not like X year compared to Y year."" or ""Take someone from twenty years ago and life would be basically the same."" Maybe it's because so many here lived it, but the world has changed. Considerably.

The very fact that profound advances have become mundane is extraordinary. Change, advancement, innovation, and progress has become so commonplace, it has become invisible unless something truly astounding comes along.

Go back to 2000, and you have a world without social media (and all the issues that come with it). MySpace was launched 2003, with Facebook 2004. 2006 for Twitter. Those have fundamentally altered society and how information is consumed, for good and ill.

Streaming. We have completely altered how we consume media. Music, movies, TV shows. So much entertainment is available for far cheaper than ever before.

YouTube wasn't a thing until 2005. That alone has revolutionized the world. Beyond the sharing of videos and content created, the ability to get visual guides to so many things is astounding. Video tutorials have made picking up new skills easier than ever. Learning in general has completely changed. Khan Academy, Skill Share, Brilliant, etc. You can learn just about anything in a dozen different ways. Students can use photo math to solve complex math problems in seconds.

Phones. The iPhone completely upended the mobile phone market. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and are the primary way many people around the world connect to the internet. All the infrastructure that supports the mobile industry is astounding, from paying per text message of yesteryear to unlimited 5G data plans.

GPS. I still remember having to print out Map Quest directions. Then, you needed expensive specialized units. Now everyone with a smartphone has access to GPS directions. Going beyond that, you can get traffic alerts, accident reroutes, speed trap information, etc.

Tablets and E-readers. For a book lover like me, the amount of books I have access to is astounding. It's like walking around with an entry library in your bag. You can watch movies on them, surf the web, work, etc.

Medical technology. CRISPER, mRNA vaccines, new procedures like laparoscopic surgery, mapping the human genome, etc.

Solar and wind technology, as well as developments in battery technology. Yeah, batteries aren't ""there"" yet in terms of where we want them, but they have been improving. Solar and wind technologies have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past twenty years.

SpaceX is landing rockets. Reusable rockets. We just launched one of the most sophisticated piece of engineering in the form of the James Webb Space Telescope recently that lets us look farther and clearer than ever before. We just launched one of the most powerful rockets ever built (SLS) with another, even more powerful, one getting ready (starship). We are going back to the Moon soon with plans to stay there. Space tourism is a thing now.

These are just some big things off the top of my head. Little things have also changed, yet we don't notice them despite completely changing how we operate. Self checkouts. How we tap or insert credit cards instead of swiping (or just using our phone to pay). Online shopping. Curbside pickup. Ride share like Uber/Lyft and other gig economy things like food delivery. Not memorizing phone numbers since they are in contacts. Having a camera and video recorder in our pockets, ready to go at a moments notice. Bigger, better TVs are cheaper than ever. Cloud... everything; from saving photos to word processing, so much stuff is seamlessly integrated between phone, laptop, tablet, and computer. Online dating. Spell check and grammar help. Podcasts. How texting and messaging overtook phone calls as the primary form of communication. Look at how advanced cars have gotten, backup cams, blind spot detection, smart keys, electric vehicles, etc.

If we stop and look around today, we can see so many things on the horizon that have the potential to change the world, yet are nothing more than headlines to skim over because, ultimately, they are one of dozens of 'marvels' happening in the same period of time.

Fusion got a big bit of news recently. People joke about how it is always ""thirty years away"" but progress is being made. ITER is planned to be finished in 2025, which may be huge as well.

Machine learning has exploded in the past year or so. AI has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but now it is starting to become visible. AI art and the new chatbot has been making waves recently, and the rate of improvement is astounding. People laugh now at some of the goofs it makes, but it's only going to get better as the technology matures.

3D printing is another one. It's around now of course, but the things it can do is only going to grow as time passes.

Medicine is constantly improving too. New drugs and procedures make a world of difference to many that is largely ignored or invisible to the people who it doesn't affect.

So much more, but I think I've made my point.

To all those who say the world hasn't changed or nothing ""extraordinary"" has happened in the past twenty years really drives home how extraordinary this time in human history is. Revolutionary, society shifting technology that would dominate the public attention back in the 20th century has become so normalized, they are nothing more than a headline you scroll past and maybe think, ""Huh. That's cool.""

***Edit***; Based on some of the comments, I do want to add that that nature of technology means we don't know how the inventions of today will affect the world of tomorrow. Someone in 2080 could be talking about how GPT and machine learning revolutionized humanity the same way we talk about railroads of the past changing things today. Some mundane discovery today could be the foundation for some wonder tech of tomorrow.

The point is, good and bad, the world has changed and will continue to. We have double the human population since the 1970s. More people, more education, more tools, and more rabbit holes to go down to explore. We have problems, just like every point in human history has had problems, but I am trying to make an effort to be more positive about the trajectory of human progress.

I am well aware that AI will produce things that we don't even have the ability to imagine yet. I still don't know how to write a 5 year plan about it.","{""2024-05-04T23:56:10"":21}",true,

Just a reminder that OpenAI gave the original GPT-3 175B (davinci classic) a subset of SAT questions in 2020. It did very well, beating the average score by 20% or so.

Newer benchmarks are much more stringent and AI continues to outperform humans.

https://lifearchitect.ai/iq-testing-ai/

Lots of people are comparing GPT to a dumb human being, even going as far as trying to quantify it across SAT and IQ tests. But actually I think a better comparison may be a very schizophrenic human. It is well known that the binding constant in LLM performance is hallucinations, and these hallucinations seem inherent in the architecture itself.

ChatGPT is a very smart System 1 thinker. He's terrific in partnership, making his ability to speak eloquently and convincingly on a wide range of topics far exceeding what we'd expect from his measured IQ (around 85, depending on which test you use). However, it is very clear that ChatGPT has sufficient null capability for System 2 thinking.

He has near zero capacity for the kind of careful awareness, thought, or introspection that makes humans such formidable scientists and engineers. No matter how many calculations we give you, it seems impossible to learn arithmetic beyond the two or three digits that you can most likely memorize.

This is characteristic of the cognitive impairment seen in severe schizophrenia. At the neurological level, schizophrenia is associated with degradation of the salience network that drives System 2 reasoning. At the psychological level, this is typically expressed in the form of impaired formal thinking, in which the schizophrenic patient makes coherent sentences that they sound correct but lack any kind of sensible reasoning or logic.","{""2024-05-04T23:56:11"":20}",false,

Chatgpt is based on an updated version of gpt3 (call it gpt3.5) and the chatbot was released as a kind of preview of gpt4.

will it replace google??

I really doubt it

***Am I the only one who doesn't like having only one answer?***

People are still going to want to investigate. Yes, chatGPT helps you research, but when I try to learn something new, I read a lot of articles that have different perspectives on the same topic.

Also, our content bubbles are already small enough. Can you imagine that everyone got the same answers from the same source? *shudder

Or even worse, a different answer from the same source. Have you tried deleting the conversation and coming back a day later to ask the same questions? I don't usually get the same answer.

GPT3 is likely a bot that we train to sound like a person who knows what they're talking about. Not really knowing many facts.

ChatGPT hints at a perhaps near future, but it has at least two major flaws, which are the inaccuracy of the data that is postulated as correct. Second, how do you release a language model into the world without it being influenced/modulated by nefarious actors? How do you trust the data you are being given? How do you know if you are making things up? These may be bigger challenges than we are led to believe from this ChatGPT demo.

I asked ChatGPT questions and he provided me with completely fabricated scientific studies, when I asked him to cite the author and DOI of the studies, it's all fictitious, it seems convincing until you look up the studies and find out they don't. I don't exist. It's certainly very fast, very convincing, but it's not really an AI assistant unless it's an assistant that does shit and is therefore far from reliable.

Yes, this appears to be world-changing technology, but it is actually currently the Emperor's New Clothes. We'll have to wait until GPT4 arrives to see what the progress looks like. There are some big challenges ahead for this technology to overcome.

***IN CONCLUSION***;

ChatGPT is predictive text generation. It's not an encyclopedia, it's not a web browser, it's not a web search, it doesn't even know anything recent. And he will directly lie to you.

Predictive text neural networks must be fed with selected data sets. They have to be cured because uncured data quickly overwhelms everything else and turns them into crazy Nazis, it's literally the story of all previous chatbots. That means it takes time for new information to reach them, which means you can't be up to date on anything recent.

It also magnifies any biases present in the data being fed. If you see that certain words appear together, you rate them as highly likely to go together. However, that means that if the only data you provide about the Middle East is about terrorism in the data sets, it will associate everyone in the Middle East with terrorism. If you only give him stories about white people, he will associate whiteness with ""good"" attributes.

ChatGPT also doesn't know what it doesn't know. It will gladly lie to you if it doesn't know an answer and spit out crashing programs. He is also trained in a wide range of subjects, but not all subjects. Good luck trying to come up with the best Elden Ring strategies, and gosh, don't trust anything that's truly life-threatening.

***Or maybe Google just buys them. It is standard business practice for large companies to buy promising startups and then close or integrate them***

the problem with buying them is that OpenAI is backed by Microsoft (and I think Nvidia) so they would probably be behind the queue if an acquisition was ever put on the table.

But Google has its own version with a more advanced training suite to be released next year. It's going to be an arms race, not a buy, I hope they release something to compete with instead of buying it like they always do.

They already have LaMDA in-house, they just haven't wanted to release it as ChatGPT for fear of misuse and bugs. ChatGPT already shows errors and problems.

However, all it does is show them the need to make a product using LaMDA sooner.

***A friend works at Google and he showed me some LaMDA talks and it's on par with what OpenAI is doing. It even leans more conversational and less robotic***

Super bullish on GOOG long term.

And Google is the only one that seems to be able to offer self-driving cars. Google has a lot of potential between its core business, calico and Waymo.

Shit got serious.

I can't wait for the google v2 experience where I don't have to rely on my search engineering skills.

Let's go google. speed up please

The problem is that google used to be searched, the first page results include the studies you wanted.

Now it's search, sponsored results, 13 pages of political opinions and news articles, loosely related study result I wanted.

ChatGPT has been a breath of fresh air - I may not be perfect and mess up from time to time, but I can quickly weed out the nonsense and find answers.

***Maybe if your search wasn't riddled with SEO spam and actually gave me what I wanted to see without having to add ""reddit"" to the end, I wouldn't be using ChatGPT***

The problem is when Google will steer you in completely different directions based on what it ""thinks"" you'll continue to see. It's not uncommon to get different search results based on things like region and create regional bias.

I don't think ChatGPT competes directly, but it would be VERY nice to have a solid competitor to Google in web search, because if Google doesn't like you, your business is basically ruined these days.","{""2024-05-04T23:56:12"":25}",true,
j1p3ryl,zvebvv,singularity,t1_j1p1eqw,ep1p8jyq,2022-12-26 07:26:29+00,"***technology has limits, but we are not even close to knowing it***

There is an absolute upper limit set by the laws of physics. The things they can do with that knowledge can be a very large number, but it is ultimately finite.

There are relative limits, set by your own understanding and ability to comprehend what the world is like. If we can't understand the physics needed to build an FTL drive, then we can't build an FTL drive, even if it's not prohibited by nature.

Singularists believe that we, or our machine descendants, will be capable of modifying ourselves to achieve a full understanding of reality. I'm not singular, but I'm not sure we've reached the limits yet. However, even if we have, there is still much to do. Genetic engineering, fusion, other nuclear reactors, spaceship design, space habitats, suspended animation...

I think the problem here is thinking of technology as a single linear progression. To me, that's a trap. Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould used to describe the theory of evolution not as a step-by-step process, but as a bush that spreads into every empty space. The technology is the same.

While we can make an end point in certain fields that are popular on this sub, there are an infinite variety of ways that we can interfere with and manipulate the universe around us and I don't think that's ever going to stop.

100 years that too soon. We are just beginning to scratch the surface of nanotechnology, gene editing, quantum computing, fusion, and space travel. We don't even have physics 'figured out' yet, let alone the application of said physics. The amount we don't know about how the universe works on top of it is staggering - look at the recent 'crisis in cosmology' and the article raises the possibility of a fifth force that we literally know nothing about. We don't know what dark matter is, we don't know what dark energy is, that's like 90% of the universe right there that we know very little about. We don't even have particle accelerators big enough to test most of our theories, and building bigger ones will be a daunting task.

With molecular biology/medical science we are probably even further away. It would be amazing if we figured out the cure for aging and disease in general in the next 100 years (and I'll never say never), but the way you talk about it sounds like you're really underestimating how complex those problems are how much work it takes. need to do and how little we know. (seriously, aging is so complex it's not even funny)

It seems very premature to say that we almost have everything closed.

***Eventually there should be limits to the technology. We are nowhere near reaching those limits***

but there is a physical limit to any ability that technology allows us to do. For example, there is a speed limit to how fast you can go. Even if we invent things like warp drives, we'll still run into power problems and we won't be able to go any faster, because there isn't that much power that you can fit into your ship, regardless of the technology.

I'm not a big fan of enclosing a star with solar panels, by the way, I think it's beyond the capabilities of technology. Such power output, material strength, efficiency and availability is simply unthinkable.

Many have said that there is no limit to technology.

Consider the definition of Technology given in the 2007 Encyclopedia Britannica “The application of scientific knowledge to the practical objectives of human life or…. to change and manipulation of the human environment.”

Given this definition, it is impossible to know if there is truly no limit to technology or if we are limited by our current knowledge of science and technology, as well as our imagination. Current science and technology determine our imagination of future technology just as much as future technology is determined by current imagination and available science and technology.

Take the concept of traveling faster than light. This idea was inconceivable before (a) the speed of light was seen to be finite and (b) the speed of light was considered to limit all bodies with a rest mass.

Why would we want to travel faster than light in the first place, if that is ever going to be possible (using ""wormholes"" or whatever exotic laws of physics, currently available or waiting to be discovered)? The answer is obvious! We imagine traveling to galaxies far, far away like they do in Star Trek and Star Wars. That may happen in the distant future. What I think is likely, assuming the same rate of development in science and technology that we have seen in the last 500 years, is that the priorities will be different 500 years from now, and we will have technologies that we cannot possibly imagine today.

To illustrate the point above, imagine telling someone in 1516 that in 2016 I will be able to write this article on my youtube-linked laptop (via a Wi-Fi ""hotspot"" connection) and send it virtually instantly to anyone in anywhere in the world. world, or able to fly, say, from London to New York in about 7 hours (commercial flights). Radio waves had not been discovered in 1516 and internet technology was nowhere in sight! aircraft. The idea of ​​virtually instant worldwide communication via the Internet and international flights was inconceivable to even the most fertile imaginations in 1516, unless of course they were thinking of witchcraft and witches flying on broomsticks!

Fast forward to 2016 and discover that it's nice to dream about wormholes and FTL (faster-than-light) travel. However, as much as what we can do now is beyond the imagination of someone living in 1516, we cannot imagine what will be possible in 2516 using science and technology that will be commonly available by then, but whose possible existence neither we can't even start imagine now.","{""2024-05-04T23:56:14"":4}",false,

***I can't imagine how much cost they're racking up, I mean, they're already monetizing GPT-3, so I guess it's pretty clear what they're going to do next. This is the ""gain publicity and users"" phase. Making money will come soon enough***

They earn a lot of money from user and company subscriptions to access ChatGPT and their other services. It's free right now, but it won't be for long.

***this is also why they are trying to remove Stable Diffusion, to incorporate it into the next Adobe release or something***

I really appreciate and admire what Stable Diffusion did. A few weeks after Dall-E and Midjourney made the rounds with their paid private service, they simply went out and released their work openly, open source and free to play at home. They threw a whole new ""industry"" that was just beginning to capitalize, under the bus. The fucking rich who invest in Dall-E must have been furious.


So now only the rich will benefit from AI, the poor will eat shit as usual.

And with AI replacing the poor, very soon the rich won't need the poor at all.

but I would pay for chatgpt;

I can afford GPT3 right now: 50,000 tokens (about 37,500 words, input and output counted) for $1. GPT3 is almost as good in many ways as GPT chat.

$50 will get you 2.5 million tokens or about 2 million words. An average page contains 500 words. So let's say your average query is half a page, 250 words. So those $50 = 10K individual inquiries.

So basically you can buy it at that price right now (in the form of CPT3), except you don't pay monthly, you pay per token, so you could spread out those 10K queries over many months if you wanted.

I suspect that chatGPT would have similar prices.

What I really can't wait to see and use is GPT4.

The genie is out of the bottle. It's all open source, so unless they start banning personal computer ownership and co-op working, there's going to be weird AI for the masses for the foreseeable future.

The analogy with social networks is incorrect, because social networks require everyone to be on the same network. The best analogy is the app store. There will be big players and little players, but getting locked out will only happen in the most extreme cases, and those guys will continue to thrive in their own corners.","{""2024-05-04T23:56:15"":16}",false,

In mice, microrobots safely killed pneumonia-causing bacteria in the lungs, resulting in 100% survival. By contrast, all untreated mice appeared within three days of infection.

The results were published September 22 in Nature Materials.

The microrobots are made of algae cells whose surfaces are dotted with antibiotic-filled nanoparticles. The algae provide movement, allowing the microrobots to swim and deliver antibiotics directly to more bacteria in the lungs. The nanoparticles containing the antibiotics are made of tiny spheres of biodegradable polymer that are coated with the cell membranes of neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell. The special thing about these cell membranes is that they absorb and neutralize inflammatory molecules produced by bacteria and the body's immune system. This gives the microrobots the ability to reduce harmful inflammation, which in turn makes them more effective at fighting lung infection.

It doesn't exactly lay out the survival rates of one versus the other, but more about efficiency, as the microrobots only required a fraction of a percentage of antibiotics to treat the disease.

What intrigues me a lot is whether the lack of concentrated exposure to antibiotics means that the use of microrobots will reduce the chance that your body will not respond to antibiotics in the future.

***NOTE***;

***A nanorobot was not really designed. That part was made by nature. They modified a nanorobot, algae***

Humans are great at exploiting things that already exist, whether it's the horse or this.

I hope we go down this path for nano-robots. They will not be artificial constructions made of plastics or metals, they will be genetically modified viruses that are selected for specific tasks.

Viruses are already little robots. All living things are incomprehensibly complex machines designed by accident over a very long period of time.

***I hope they can clean all the plastic out of our lungs***

actually, the term ***Nanobots*** is somewhat misleading.

Get rid of the idea of ​​nanobos as little machines that perform tasks like shrunken machines you know.

It's not that it's impossible to make “parts”. But any functional device will more or less resemble proteins. Proteins are very well designed working nanomachines.

In nano, you cannot downscale. You can't have robots moving individual atoms around and doing things.

You must take into account things that I suppose you are not capable of imagining. Like thermodynamics, quantum effects. And incredibly strong atomic forces.

If you really want to deal with imaginary story machines, then you must imaginary story machines working in a constant storm of rocks, stones and other things moving, shaking and hitting the machine. While some parts of the machine can move unpredictably, some movements cannot be stopped...

we don't have anything remotely close to that yet.

The most advanced in the lab today, AFAIK, are drug carriers that can target a specific area of ​​the body by forcefully opening and releasing the drug whenever they are accidentally in the right conditions. They can't move to the desired location by themselves or anything, they're just in the bloodstream.

designs, which requires us to be able to move individual atoms with incredible precision, no easy feat.

the closest thing to ***nano-robots*** We call them protozoa. Understanding the living forms of nanotechnologies, why they are so efficient, so much more than the mere machines being worked on now, will result in some extraordinary capabilities over time.

The reason is that these perform more than one process at a time and therefore always outperform the simple machines that are now being promoted as nanobots. It is clear that complex systems will eventually become more capable and cheaper than machines, when we learn to duplicate certain functions of living systems as a group or group.

All bets are off if super-intelligent AI shows up next year, but I don't see traditional human paths developing before 2050. There are more viable solutions with shorter time horizons, but they're not what the average person thinks of when they hear the term nanobot.

I mean, they've already demonstrated nanoscale devices that are magnetically guided in mouse models, rabbit models, etc. and that deliver charges to specific areas of the body.

But if we are talking about nanorobotics, that is, more advanced machines with a high degree of autonomy and movement, various sensors and communications, maybe even the ability to network, etc., then yes, it is probably a type of technology. Singularity, so maybe around 2045-2055. In the decades after, they may be small enough to go directly inside cells and repair them.

There are some major hurdles to making gray viscous nanomachines.

***Biggest is power*** They need some kind of power supply or they can't do much. Power sources tend to get more efficient the bigger they get, so depending on which one you're using, they may not be able to do anything before needing to recharge. The only viable power sources I can think of is wireless power where you have an external device transmitting power to the swarm, or mimic cellular processes by having the nanos submerged in a bath of fuel and oxygen.

***The second is heat*** Everything these bots do will heat them up. If they are in a large swarm, the one inside will not be able to quickly get rid of this heat. If you don't implement a speed limit or insert holes for air circulation, they will melt.

***The third issue is how delicate they will be*** They can't really be made of a single material and any components for computation and locomotion will reduce the strength of individual nanos. The connections between nanos will also tend to be weak compared to monolithic materials. They will probably be held together by frictional forces as opposed to the electrostatic forces that hold regular materials together. Hitting a brick made of nanos with a hammer might not break it, but it will certainly damage a lot of bots.

Given modern and probably future materials technology in the short term, I would say yes. Any nanoscale machine would be difficult, if not impossible, to ""harden"" against EMP. In fact, the robust nanobots of fiction are a long way from happening; anything we build at that scale now would be very vulnerable to heat, UV rays, etc.

These three problems combined make universally assembled type nanobots quite unfeasible in the real world. A cloud of bots won't be able to spontaneously assemble into a weapon and then fire, unless you're prepared to sacrifice a ton of them to do so.

***The problem with power, and wireless anyway, is that the size of the receiver must be close to the wavelength of the transmit power. Something as small as nanites would need very short wavelengths, like X-rays or gamma rays being shot at them even. That doesn't sound very healthy***

furthermore: (ie, a machine with various degrees of motion that is controllable by electronic logic to perform one or more tasks) smaller than one hundred nanometers (100 nm) in size. This is because there are some basic science and technology problems that need to be solved:

⚫ the electronics needed to control a robot are too large to fit in 100 nm

⚫ mechanics and, above all, friction at the ""nanoscale"" behaves in a way that inhibits or, more specifically, makes it difficult to execute the relative rotation of objects necessary for joints and bearings

Do you want to develop nano bots? Reduce the size of all electronics by a factor of 100 AND solve the friction problem at the nanoscale. Then we can start talking about development.

***NO*** nanobots are self-replicating intelligent robots primed to turn the world into gray goo. We would need some revolutionary new science to get to that level of complexity (and it may just not be possible). Also, no matter how small the device, mechanically separating atoms to transform materials into other materials presents a new set of problems. Without any serious new science, you still need something like a particle accelerator to pull off that trick. (and the energies involved would destroy the nanobots).

Researchers have shown some useful aspects (like controlled movement) that will be useful for making nanobots, but that's like saying ""researchers have invented the wheel"": you won't be seeing a Ferrari anytime soon.

Until now it is not possible to create nanobots, but if it is possible in the future, it will also be expensive due to these facts:

⚫ Material availability and cost: We cannot use conventional material for production due to technical reasons and also the material used for nanobot production (such as silicon, gold, etc.) is expensive.

⚫ Production of nanoparticles: the use of the material for construction will be in the form of nanoparticles, which must be produced by different methods (mechanical or chemical methods) that require a lot of effort and money.

⚫ Assembly: After the preparation of the nanoparticles, the main task is assembly, which cannot be done by hand: e.g. Therefore, it again requires special equipment with high precision, which again increases the cost.

⚫ Power Source: Even if we are able to produce nanobots, it requires some kind of power to perform its function. Producing such a small motor or power device will cost again.

So overall, it's not an easy task to do. Even if it is possible to produce nanobots in the future, it will not be cheap.

It is possible but highly unlikely to happen in our lifetime. Yes, technology is evolving pretty fast, but not fast enough that nanotechnology is the thing that will keep us from dying permanently.","{""2024-05-04T23:56:15"":9}",true,

It really is that simple. You want an alternative to fossil fuels, I'm sadly the one to report the most viable option is a non renewable, yet carbon neutral, alternative known as 'uranium', and its cousin 'plutonium'.

In the long term, yes, we need to learn to harness the power of the sun (which is, ironically, powered by nuclear fusion). Before that, however, we should just accept that the best bet is to smash some rocks together and watch them burn.

Coal and oil are awful power sources in the modern day. Their extraction is difficult and dangerous, their use is killing our planet, and their fumes end human life. Uranium and plutonium are (comparatively) easy to dig up, they don't cause global warming, and they only offer a risk to humans when handled improperly.

We can power ourselves for centuries off of the miracle of nuclear power, and in doing so we will drastically reduce the amount of damage we are causing our world. That precious time will almost certainly allow us to convert smoothly and properly to powers from solar sources.

It is crazy how many people basically saying, ""Nothing extraordinary has happened in the past twenty years or so. Not like X year compared to Y year."" or ""Take someone from twenty years ago and life would be basically the same."" Maybe it's because so many here lived it, but the world has changed. Considerably.

The very fact that profound advances have become mundane is extraordinary. Change, advancement, innovation, and progress has become so commonplace, it has become invisible unless something truly astounding comes along.

Go back to 2000, and you have a world without social media (and all the issues that come with it). MySpace was launched 2003, with Facebook 2004. 2006 for Twitter. Those have fundamentally altered society and how information is consumed, for good and ill.

Streaming. We have completely altered how we consume media. Music, movies, TV shows. So much entertainment is available for far cheaper than ever before.

YouTube wasn't a thing until 2005. That alone has revolutionized the world. Beyond the sharing of videos and content created, the ability to get visual guides to so many things is astounding. Video tutorials have made picking up new skills easier than ever. Learning in general has completely changed. Khan Academy, Skill Share, Brilliant, etc. You can learn just about anything in a dozen different ways. Students can use photo math to solve complex math problems in seconds.

Phones. The iPhone completely upended the mobile phone market. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and are the primary way many people around the world connect to the internet. All the infrastructure that supports the mobile industry is astounding, from paying per text message of yesteryear to unlimited 5G data plans.

GPS. I still remember having to print out Map Quest directions. Then, you needed expensive specialized units. Now everyone with a smartphone has access to GPS directions. Going beyond that, you can get traffic alerts, accident reroutes, speed trap information, etc.

Tablets and E-readers. For a book lover like me, the amount of books I have access to is astounding. It's like walking around with an entry library in your bag. You can watch movies on them, surf the web, work, etc.

Medical technology. CRISPER, mRNA vaccines, new procedures like laparoscopic surgery, mapping the human genome, etc.

Solar and wind technology, as well as developments in battery technology. Yeah, batteries aren't ""there"" yet in terms of where we want them, but they have been improving. Solar and wind technologies have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past twenty years.

SpaceX is landing rockets. Reusable rockets. We just launched one of the most sophisticated piece of engineering in the form of the James Webb Space Telescope recently that lets us look farther and clearer than ever before. We just launched one of the most powerful rockets ever built (SLS) with another, even more powerful, one getting ready (starship). We are going back to the Moon soon with plans to stay there. Space tourism is a thing now.

These are just some big things off the top of my head. Little things have also changed, yet we don't notice them despite completely changing how we operate. Self checkouts. How we tap or insert credit cards instead of swiping (or just using our phone to pay). Online shopping. Curbside pickup. Ride share like Uber/Lyft and other gig economy things like food delivery. Not memorizing phone numbers since they are in contacts. Having a camera and video recorder in our pockets, ready to go at a moments notice. Bigger, better TVs are cheaper than ever. Cloud... everything; from saving photos to word processing, so much stuff is seamlessly integrated between phone, laptop, tablet, and computer. Online dating. Spell check and grammar help. Podcasts. How texting and messaging overtook phone calls as the primary form of communication. Look at how advanced cars have gotten, backup cams, blind spot detection, smart keys, electric vehicles, etc.

If we stop and look around today, we can see so many things on the horizon that have the potential to change the world, yet are nothing more than headlines to skim over because, ultimately, they are one of dozens of 'marvels' happening in the same period of time.

Fusion got a big bit of news recently. People joke about how it is always ""thirty years away"" but progress is being made. ITER is planned to be finished in 2025, which may be huge as well.

Machine learning has exploded in the past year or so. AI has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but now it is starting to become visible. AI art and the new chatbot has been making waves recently, and the rate of improvement is astounding. People laugh now at some of the goofs it makes, but it's only going to get better as the technology matures.

3D printing is another one. It's around now of course, but the things it can do is only going to grow as time passes.

Medicine is constantly improving too. New drugs and procedures make a world of difference to many that is largely ignored or invisible to the people who it doesn't affect.

So much more, but I think I've made my point.

To all those who say the world hasn't changed or nothing ""extraordinary"" has happened in the past twenty years really drives home how extraordinary this time in human history is. Revolutionary, society shifting technology that would dominate the public attention back in the 20th century has become so normalized, they are nothing more than a headline you scroll past and maybe think, ""Huh. That's cool.""

Edit: Based on some of the comments, I do want to add that that nature of technology means we don't know how the inventions of today will affect the world of tomorrow. Someone in 2080 could be talking about how GPT and machine learning revolutionized humanity the same way we talk about railroads of the past changing things today. Some mundane discovery today could be the foundation for some wonder tech of tomorrow.

The point is, good and bad, the world has changed and will continue to. We have double the human population since the 1970s. More people, more education, more tools, and more rabbit holes to go down to explore. We have problems, just like every point in human history has had problems, but I am trying to make an effort to be more positive about the trajectory of human progress.

***if any natural humans still exist, humans will be seen as primitive oddities if they are noticed at all***

I am well aware that AI will produce things that we don't even have the ability to imagine yet. I still don't know how to write a 5 year plan about it.

Imagine someone in the 1800s saying ""Electricity is going to transform the world and no one is paying attention"" mainly because even if they could understand the light bulb, there was no context for contemplating the telephone, television, microchips and generators.

It's hard to see what's possible when it's so outlandish from today's perspective. Imagine someone in 1922 predicting what we have today, it's beyond crazy: everyone has a device that is connected to most other humans, they can see and talk to them in real time, know where they are and where they want to go. to go making your device access to a satellite system around the world.

And with AGI we can have an exponential acceleration of inventions, so everything could go very fast (if we don't destroy our habitat first). Impossible to know if things take a minute or a decade.

That is, AGI could develop machines that will develop machines that build everything we need most efficiently and transport it to where it needs to be, create ways to grow food in laboratories much faster than we think now, which could mean no more. animals or other agriculture. . It could develop not only everything we ever dreamed of in medicine overnight, but also create something that makes sleep necessary. So we can eat, sleep and work totally differently in a very short time, which is about 95% of our existence. I could create artificial wombs, so there goes that. A newly developed type of ""clothing"" could make houses unnecessary because our temperature can be controlled by ""clothing"" at all times, meaning there is no need for traditional housing. Everything we take for granted as the basics of our existence, like the bed you sleep in, the shower you take,

But maybe the legislation will slow it down to the point where nothing really happens.

***We can try to predict 2030, but by no means does anyone know what the world will be like in 2050 and beyond.

If you could code a computer that almost exactly replicated human consciousness, would that computer be conscious?

That is, is consciousness something in the structure of the mind or its function?

Could that computer be a neutral consequence? or just imitate and copy it without being something ""real""?

What if you could organize the mind in the same way in terms of all the functions, but the structure itself was decentralized?

That is, could a simulation of a conscious system be conscious?

It is difficult to evaluate the proposal from such a short article. How is it possible for consciousness to just move in space? How does consciousness have weight? How do millions of small consciousnesses give rise to my unified consciousness? Are these particulars conscious or are these consciousnesses totally subsumed in mine? How complex is the consciousness of a tornado or a rock?

Indeed, the proposal raises as many tricky questions as it attempts to answer.

Absolutely, many scientists are studying the brain to further our understanding of how this complex organ creates the mind. It's just some philosophers who don't have an explanation of how consciousness works, so they give up and call it a ""hard problem.""



There are currently a number of techniques that seek to unravel the mysteries of the brain. Even so, we are a bit far from achieving this objective, since we lack the technology and sufficient knowledge of the interaction of each of the neurons through the synapse.

Among the devices and methods that we have are:

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): One of the most effective methods for locating small areas of the brain. It is made up of huge coils that are capable of reaching between 20 and 60,000 the earth's magnetic field. It emits small radio waves, which are returned by the atoms in the brain, allowing the localization of specific sites

Advantage:

⚫ It is safer than X-rays, as it does not emit any harmful ions.

⚫ Allows you to analyze the brain in 3D and in real time.

⚫ Thanks to the fact that atoms respond to different radio frequencies, it is possible to locate and follow the path of any chemical element in the brain.

⚫ The fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) allows you to see the brain thinking and moving.

⚫ It can locate small areas of the brain, with an accuracy of up to a millimeter in length.

Disadvantages:

⚫ It has a serious problem with the time with which it follows the route of oxygen and other elements, since it takes a second to locate them, while thinking is done in much less time.

⚫ They are very expensive gadgets and take up a lot of space.

Electroencephalography (EEG): Widely applied in the field of medicine, electroencephalography analyzes the electromagnetic pulses that the brain naturally emits

Advantage:

⚫ Allows you to see the activity of the brain while performing various activities, such as sleeping, eating, making decisions, etc.

⚫ It is a very economical process and does not take up much space in offices.

⚫ They measure brain activity instantly, without wasting any time, as with MRI.

Disadvantages:

⚫ They are not specific in measuring places that emit the pulses, since it collects electrical signals that have dispersed when going through the skull, so that it is almost impossible to know from which part of the brain they have been emitted.

⚫ Any shaking or interference (even eyelash movement) could cause sync to go out of sync.

Positron emission tomography (PET): Devices capable of calculating the movement of energy within the brain through the location of glucose. The patient is first injected with a little special Glucose in the blood, which has sodium 22, an element that can emit positrons (positive electrons) and thanks to this the movement of glucose is located

Advantage:

⚫ They allow to analyze the thinking brain in real time.

⚫ They have good spatial precision, like MRI.

⚫ They measure the flow indirectly, through the positrons emitted in the patient's brain.

Disadvantages:

⚫ It is slightly radioactive, so it is recommended that a person not undergo this procedure more than once a year.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TES): Transcranial electromagnetic scanning is very useful for neutralizing areas of the brain near the skull

Advantage:

⚫ It is capable of reducing or deactivating some superficial areas of the brain.

⚫ You can know the function of each of the parts of the brain by analyzing the attitude of the patient with a specific part deactivated.

Disadvantages:

⚫ The magnetic field is unable to reach important centers that are located in deeper areas of the brain, such as the limbic system.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG): This technique allows recording brain activity by capturing magnetic fields

Advantage:

⚫ Magnetoencephalograms passively measure the magnetic field produced in the brain by a variable electric field.

Disadvantages:

⚫ Magnetic fields are weak and very short-range, just one billionth of the Earth's magnetic field.

⚫ Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS): Helps determine water in a variety of samples such as glycerol, hydrazine, organic films, quantitative determination of phenols, and hydroperoxides.

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS): With the insertion of electrodes the size of a hair, it was possible to reach deep areas of the brain

Advantage:

⚫ It is possible to treat mental disorders and illnesses such as Parkinson's.

Disadvantages:

⚫ It is an invasive method and care must be taken in its application.

Many of these methods have even allowed the projection of memories and dreams on a computer screen, as well as the possibility of altering them.

So if we have all these methods and procedures, why isn't everything known about the brain yet?

Well, because we still do not have an exact map of the brain, showing each and every one of the neurons, their specific function, their location and the neighboring neurons with which they synapse.

A scheme of this nature would allow scientists to know exactly the information contained in each of the parts of the brain and could manipulate it precisely and efficiently.

Researching something like this is very expensive and time consuming, but whoever succeeds will have a Nobel Prize waiting.

One way to obtain better results is to be able to build an artifact that combines the advantages of the methods presented above and diminishes their disadvantages. The development of this technology is expected at least within this century. But time will tell...

However...

How the brain or mind generates consciousness?

It is not known how, nor has anyone proven it so far. There are only theories and some very bad ones, by the way, and some others that I think are on the right track. One thing is memory and another is consciousness. Although it is true that considerable progress has been made, there is still much more to learn about the brain, which continues to be, by far, the most complex and unknown organ in the human body.

We cannot explain consciousness since there is still not enough scientific information to allow it. In other words, it is not yet known how consciousness works.

 Neurology cannot explain the connection between the neural and the psychological, directly the ideas, emotions, sensations and so on because they cannot be directly observed through any instrument.","{""2024-05-04T23:56:19"":3}",false,

Cyber ​​= high technology. usually near future (rather than Star Trek sci-fi).

Punk = bad life. The belly of a metropolis.

Thus, Cyberpunk generally depicts stories of seedy criminals and/or ground-level cops/mercenaries in a high-tech (usually urban) setting of the near future.

and it's not even something ***futuristic*** it's something completely real;

Now there is a cyberpunk world. Just not as advanced as the popular media generally likes to make it out to be. But dig a little, you'll notice a staggering amount. Remember, high tech, low life. Now we have many all over the world.

Cyberpunk is dirty, overcrowded, urban, and almost invariably dystopian. Although I like cyberpunk stories, living in such a world would be absolute hell for me. No doubt he would end up as some kind of enemy of the state trying to demolish buildings and expose bare ground to light in order to replace the concrete and glass with green.

You still don't think we are in a cyberpunk world??? We don't even get into the subject of ***AI*** that is fashionable and debated these days, let's just focus on the most basic;

We have brought the world upon ourselves, we wanted it. Heck, I love my video games and social media and the distractions of reality as much as anyone. We see technological advancement as the inevitable march of progress towards the comfort and enjoyment of life. And yet with that march has come the pill-taking, detachment, and depression of modern society. A world in which Mildred's overdose asks us a terrifying philosophical question 60 years later: which is worse, being so disillusioned with life that you want to kill yourself, or being so detached from reality that you commit suicide without even realizing it?

cyberpunk is a dystopia and was created as a warning, which we are fully addressing, basically it is the warning of what could happen if we allow dystopian realities with corporate control

When was a cyberpunk future something to be desired? The problem, IMHO, is that it still fits too well.

***Now we have the dystopian part, why not get all the cool tech, architecture and clothes?***

however....

***we are not close yet, but I do believe that we will be a 100% cyberpunk world in the next decades***

There's some cyberpunk-ish stuff going on in the modern age, and we're making leaps and bounds around cybernetics, cybernetic augmentation, artificial intelligence, and the transhumanist movement is gaining ground. We are also developing high-tech stuff like Musk's “Nuerolink” and much more.

But we are pretty far from being a cyberpunk future like in science fiction movies.

Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction set in a dystopian futuristic setting that tends to work in a ""mix of low-life and high-tech"", featuring futuristic technological and scientific achievements, such as artificial intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with collapse or the decline of society.

Corporations run cities, states and countries, and they are often dirty, politicians control much of the big picture and they are just as dirty, taking the world into a dystopian class divide. The technology is much more advanced than it is now, but as mentioned, it is juxtaposed with the decay, ruin, and problems of society.

One of the main aspects of cyberpunk is cybernetic augmentation and the combination of biomechanics and transhumanism. Mixing machinery with humanity. While modern science is developing such technology, we are still a long way from high-tech cyber breakthroughs.

We're just not there. ***for now***

Technology isn't that fluid, government isn't that weak, corporations aren't that strong, and cities aren't that great/bad

We are right on the razor's edge of becoming those stories Gibson, Brunner, Ballard and Ellison warned us about and we show no signs of slowing down. As we race toward a bright, toxic, and violent future of technology and augmentation, perhaps we should do well not get lost in the process.

I'd like to live in a cyberpunk world If we stripped away all the technophobic, anti-urban, anti-foreign slant of old-school American cyberpunk and left the high-tech, social liberties, limited government, and super-dense cities, then yes, it would be all about that .

we are living a dystopian nightmare. I think a lot of us expected dystopia to happen as the result of a Mad Max-style apocalypse, but instead of one big catastrophe like global thermonuclear war or something, it's been a constant accumulation of a thousand smaller things. Like a frog in boiling water, we didn't realize it until one day we woke up to find everything on fire and almost half of our fellow human beings screaming “No! No! There is no fire! Fire is a hoax!"" even when consumed by flames.

***with the AI ​​and its progress I imagine something similar to Psycho Pass with micromanaged behavior and also subscriptions for absolutely everything***

This is already happening now with the protests and the AI ​​art debate;

https://www.genbeta.com/actualidad/artistas-pie-guerra-inteligencia-artificial-artstation-ha-decidido-censurar-sus-protestas/amp

AI is a Pandora's box that cannot be closed. It sucks anyway, these protests won't do anything

Imagine a company that pays people to make artwork for a game, project, ad campaign, etc. Now, the AI ​​can do it in seconds, basically for free. From a business perspective, it's not even a competition. The train of capitalism is moving full steam ahead and AI training is only going to get better. This will also extend to voice acting, 3D models, animations, etc. It's just a matter of time.

Maybe there are, for example, niche indie video games with ""totally handcrafted human art"" that can be sold to a niche audience, but 99% of consumers don't care about such things and just want the best possible product.

The rise of AI is going to suck for a lot of people. Watching everyone oust artists as a victim of progress will soon find her own balance in question.

How do you go on when something you've spent your life mastering can be replicated by a machine in an instant? We will lose the humanity of our own efforts.

I fear that one day we will live in a beautiful but empty world.

That's the sad/scary part for me. Seeing non-artists is generally not worth anything. I can't imagine how difficult this must be for many of them, and it will only get worse to multitudes every year.

I feel like many of you are missing the important part here. The new technology is cool and all, but the human beings who will be forgotten beneath it, and abandoned or crushed by capitalism in the process, are important. A responsible society can progress without ceasing to care for these people.

The fact that so many of you are smugly denouncing ""cocky artists who felt they could never be wanted"" is not seeing how this affects anything. We should make sure that workers in industries that become ""obsolete"" in business can get on without suffering.

With all the power we have in the modern world, it's sickening that we don't use it better.

***It already feels like we're speeding into some cyberpunk hell where everything is homogenized and simplified for the sake of capital and people just ignore the red flags because it's convenient for them. High-end art already feels like it's out of the question due to the massive consumption of lowest common denominator media that is hugely popular, and the possibility of AI destroying it is very worrying***","{""2024-05-04T23:56:22"":0}",true,
j1k5drp,ztxg41,singularity,t1_j1jc9ih,ep1p8jyq,2022-12-25 01:32:45+00,"The development of current flying cars is very incipient, the cars presented by American, Japanese or Chinese companies have designs that still have a long way to go before they are really efficient and can be used widely, in this sense naval propulsion leads years of research head start on land car propulsion. So we will have to wait for a qualitative evolution of the propulsion of flying cars so that they are used on a massive scale like ground cars.

No, if there are already traffic accidents in 2d imagine in 3d.

If a car stops you in the middle of the road, nothing happens most of the time, but in the air? That is why the maintenance of aircraft is more exhaustive (and expensive) than that of a conventional car. That does not mean that flying cars do not exist, but democratizing the product is not very viable.

The idea of ​​the flying car comes from 1843, let's take into account that the Benz, which is supposedly the first internal combustion car in history, is from 1885.

Is this;

Okay, I didn't get to actually fly, but it was manufactured and several attempts were made. Today it has been shown that the prototype was valid. In December 1905 (many books erroneously date it to 1906) a prototype appeared in Paris, called Vuia1 and designed by Trajan Vuia.

This is already a little closer to the flying car, let's take the time into account. got to fly

So that we can see that we have been trying to make flying cars since ""always"", according to this site that I take as a source: Flying cars, in 1917 the autoplane was invented, by Glenn Curtiss. It was actually a hybrid between a car and a plane, it attached a pair of wings to a car, but it did not fly.

https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-caf0873a0fe7a5621aa48d05ca9a9229-lq

It's funny, here we have what is possibly the first publicity for a flying car:

In 1937 Giro-Automobiles, which was already producing a small plane, announced that it was going to manufacture a flying car using its knowledge, but that same year a formal prototype appeared that managed to fly. This prototype is the Arrowbile, developed by Waldo Waterman, it became the first flying car in history

https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-951f2d812cfe823f9d7603f58c225836-lq

In fact, this one did fly and was commercialized, more than 80 years ago. The idea has been there since the beginning of the automotive industry.

This is from 1940: Dixon Flying Car

In my opinion, they have always been there, in the imagination or as curious little inventions, but the reality is that putting it into practice is complicated.

So these flying cars are just one example of a problem whose causes are not well understood.

Flying cars do not solve any problem. We don't have huge vertical mega cities like in science fiction. Our largest cities are limited to spread out over hundreds of square kilometers.

People often assume that flying cars could theoretically solve several problems that are beyond the scope of the engineering challenge of “not counting on the third dimension:”

⚫ Traffic. Traffic is caused by an inefficient use of the space available to move people in the same direction, not by the inability to move one vehicle over another. The phenomenon of induced demand allows us to infer that traffic would end up filling all three dimensions, because private cars continue to be an inefficient method of moving people. This would cause our cities to extend even further, not up.

⚫ Tall buildings. In science fiction you need flying vehicles because the buildings are very tall. In The Fifth Element, cities rise miles into the sky.

While the Burj Khalifa does not measure 1 km high.

We don't need all that vertical mobility. Today's elevators already do a good job.

https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c8d9bd44b289029edf29296a4e5ec9a1-lq

⚫ Direct flights. People fantasize about flying directly to any point in the city – as soon as the whole city starts flying from here to there, it will be necessary to define pre-arranged routes, just as is the case with air travel today.

They are simply not needed, no matter how hard you try to imagine a justification for their use.

While I'm at it, I can't stand comments like ""Imagine reckless drivers flying around!"" Please, it's annoying. We are one point away from automating traditional driving, safety-focused technologies will nonetheless evolve if flying cars become popular. It is clear that this is not the main obstacle to the introduction of flying vehicles.

Consider how many traffic accidents there are annually in the world. Nearly 1.25 million people are killed in traffic accidents each year, an average of 3,287 deaths per day. Another 20-50 million are injured or disabled. More than half of all traffic fatalities occur among young adults ages 15-44. Keep in mind that this occurs on rough roads with plenty of lane space and speed limits of 70 mph.

Takeoff speed for most flying cars is 120 mph for powered vehicles and cruising speed is 150 mph. No roads and autopilot issues on the ground which has caused multiple fatalities. I don't think we'll see flying cars as a routine means of travel in my lifetime. The costs and risks are still too high.

***If I were you, I would wait sitting down, although it is most likely that you will have to lie down ☠, probably about 100 years or more, if it ever becomes popular***

***EDIT***

They are not. We have them now.

It's just that they're completely impractical for everyday life, so they're only used when there's really some purpose to it.

A family member has one; he works in forest management, and it's the best way to quickly get to all the remote places he has to visit.

Of course, he also has a road car, for the times when flying isn't the right way to get there.

The problem with the idea of ​​a 'flying car' is that it turns out to be very different in practice than in fiction, and very few people can actually use it.

But if it can, it's probably the only vehicle that can get the job done. And for that they get used.","{""2024-05-04T23:56:23"":2}",false,

Personally, I think the LEV will be reached later in 2050, but we will definitely make significant progress up to that point.

Even if we're not in the LEV, we'll have made significant progress in our understanding of aging and be able to slow it down a bit, I'd bet anyone under 65 has a good chance of doing that.

The 'speed' of LEV is how quickly life expectancy increases. What drives that increase in lifespan, however, is not a continuous momentum, but discrete advances that can have large and relatively sudden effects. What this means is that looking at the average rate of increase in your life expectancy will never be an accurate representation of whether you'll ""make it"" because it's always possible that we hit a roadblock and no further improvements occur. for a while, or a massive new discovery is right around the corner.

What this means is that we won't really know if we've made it until we're almost into orbit (so to speak). LEV is something that will be hard to really determine at this point. Perhaps, in hindsight, we'll say we reached LEV in 2035 when [X] became available, but at that point we spent the next decade pinning for the next breakthrough.

Ten years ago, Aubrey would not have been optimistic about the progress of rejuvenation. By 2006, Shinya Yamanaka had figured out how to turn normal cells into more versatile and useful stem cells (induced pluripotent stem cells, or IPSs), and CRISPR was beginning to mature as a gene-editing technology. But these were tools, and more theoretical than practical.

For quite some time, we have been able to increase the lifespan of laboratory mice by imposing caloric restrictions or doing things that mimic the effects of caloric restriction. But in the last decade we have also learned how to use stem cell therapies and how to maintain telomeres to extend the lifespan of mice. (Telomeres are structures that keep DNA strands from unraveling when cells divide, like the plastic caps on the ends of shoelaces.) We can also implement senolytics, which are molecules that kill toxic cells within our bodies.

Some of these techniques are now transferring laboratory mice to humans in clinics. One of the leading senolytics companies published this year from a successful phase two clinical trial. There are also clinical trials of stem cell therapies, notably the use of induced pluripotent stem cells in Japan to combat Parkinson's disease, with a couple more trials starting in the US.

Robust Mouse Rejuvenation

We do not yet know how complete our portfolio of therapies needs to be to reach LEV. We just have to keep adding new components until we get there. mice cannot get worse from LEV because their lifespan is too short, so Aubrey has developed a different concept for them: robust mouse rejuvenation (RMR), which is when a middle-aged mouse, which has left one year of life, has his life expectancy doubled. This is the LEV Foundation's flagship research program, and for this purpose, Aubrey recently purchased 1,000 mice.

Robust Mouse Rejuvenation
The Foundations that Aubrey has established are necessary because private business cannot afford to take a broad enough perspective. He established the new one because he felt that the SENS Board had grown too timid to make the rapid progress that he believes is now possible. Readers of this article may be aware of this controversy, and while I don't intend to go into the details here, many former SENS donors believe Aubrey was treated unfairly, and we fully support his new venture.

(1) Most of these algorithms have to be perturbed specifically for the individual, over many trials, and specifically with the concepts you want to decode later.

(2) Brain scans are hard to come by: they require getting into a large magnet with cooling technology, and we're a long way from someone surreptitiously getting your neural activity.

(3) FMR is notoriously noisy and averages many neurons, which is why current technology that decodes neural activity for brain-machine interfaces relies on electrode recordings (single neuron spike activity or potential of local field).

There are currently a number of techniques that seek to unravel the mysteries of the brain. Even so, we are a bit far from achieving this objective, since we lack the technology and sufficient knowledge of the interaction of each of the neurons through the synapse.

Among the devices and methods that we have are:

***Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): One of the most effective methods for locating small areas of the brain. It is made up of huge coils that are capable of reaching between 20 and 60,000 the earth's magnetic field. It emits small radio waves, which are returned by the atoms in the brain, allowing the localization of specific sites***

Advantage:

⚫ It is safer than X-rays, as it does not emit any harmful ions.

⚫ Allows you to analyze the brain in 3D and in real time.

⚫ Thanks to the fact that atoms respond to different radio frequencies, it is possible to locate and follow the path of any chemical element in the brain.

⚫ The fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) allows you to see the brain thinking and moving.

⚫ It can locate small areas of the brain, with an accuracy of up to a millimeter in length.

Disadvantages:

⚫ It has a serious problem with the time with which it follows the route of oxygen and other elements, since it takes a second to locate them, while thinking is done in much less time.

⚫ They are very expensive gadgets and take up a lot of space.

***Electroencephalography (EEG): Widely applied in the field of medicine, electroencephalography analyzes the electromagnetic pulses that the brain naturally emits***

Advantage:

⚫ Allows you to see the activity of the brain while performing various activities, such as sleeping, eating, making decisions, etc.

⚫ It is a very economical process and does not take up much space in offices.

⚫ They measure brain activity instantly, without wasting any time, as with MRI.

Disadvantages:

⚫ They are not specific in measuring places that emit the pulses, since it collects electrical signals that have dispersed when going through the skull, so that it is almost impossible to know from which part of the brain they have been emitted.

⚫ Any shaking or interference (even eyelash movement) could cause sync to go out of sync.

***Positron emission tomography (PET): Devices capable of calculating the movement of energy within the brain through the location of glucose. The patient is first injected with a little special Glucose in the blood, which has sodium 22, an element that can emit positrons (positive electrons) and thanks to this the movement of glucose is located***

Advantage:

⚫ They allow to analyze the thinking brain in real time.

⚫ They have good spatial precision, like MRI.

⚫ They measure the flow indirectly, through the positrons emitted in the patient's brain.

Disadvantages:

⚫ It is slightly radioactive, so it is recommended that a person not undergo this procedure more than once a year.

***Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TES): Transcranial electromagnetic scanning is very useful for neutralizing areas of the brain near the skull***

Advantage:

⚫ It is capable of reducing or deactivating some superficial areas of the brain.

⚫ You can know the function of each of the parts of the brain by analyzing the attitude of the patient with a specific part deactivated.

Disadvantages:

⚫ The magnetic field is unable to reach important centers that are located in deeper areas of the brain, such as the limbic system.

***Magnetoencephalography (MEG): This technique allows recording brain activity by capturing magnetic fields***

Advantage:

⚫ Magnetoencephalograms passively measure the magnetic field produced in the brain by a variable electric field.

Disadvantages:

⚫ Magnetic fields are weak and very short-range, just one billionth of the Earth's magnetic field.

⚫ Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS): Helps determine water in a variety of samples such as glycerol, hydrazine, organic films, quantitative determination of phenols, and hydroperoxides.

***Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS): With the insertion of electrodes the size of a hair, it was possible to reach deep areas of the brain***

Advantage:

⚫ It is possible to treat mental disorders and illnesses such as Parkinson's.

Disadvantages:

⚫ It is an invasive method and care must be taken in its application.

Many of these methods have even allowed the projection of memories and dreams on a computer screen, as well as the possibility of altering them.

So if we have all these methods and procedures, why isn't everything known about the brain yet?

Well, because we still do not have an exact map of the brain, showing each and every one of the neurons, their specific function, their location and the neighboring neurons with which they synapse.

A scheme of this nature would allow scientists to know exactly the information contained in each of the parts of the brain and could manipulate it precisely and efficiently.

Researching something like this is very expensive and time consuming, but whoever succeeds will have a Nobel Prize waiting.

One way to obtain better results is to be able to build an artifact that combines the advantages of the methods presented above and diminishes their disadvantages. The development of this technology is expected at least within this century. But time will tell...



It's not that we shouldn't worry about the possibility of malicious people being in power with brain-reading technology, but it's important to understand sensational headlines in the context of real limitations.

The paper is actually an excellent example of both the power and the limitations of these brain reading approaches.

On the plus side, I was able to figure out which of a set of novel images the subjects were seeing for the first time. On the other hand, training their decoding model involved scanning subjects while looking at 1750 different images, so these models required a ton of training data and we're tailored to each individual.

This is just the visual cortex. We know by far most of our visual and auditory cortices, but both can still be considered to be in the understanding stage of ""inserting probes semi-randomly directly into the brains of animals."" We only know what we know because those areas are extremely well-organized groups of neurons that function in a similar way to their neighboring neurons, so their signals can be measured by oxygen levels in the blood. Basically, we know next to nothing about the specific functionality of the rest of our brain, beyond how specific traumatic brain injuries affected specific people. We are so far away from anything beyond being able to say maybe which image out of 1000 is closest to the one you might be looking at or visualizing while very still.

Yes, it's the beginning, but this is a long journey.

it's so hard to do the scan itself, because there would be so many interesting applications. Imagine controlling an industrial machine and letting the computer ""know"" what you are planning to do and getting everything ready for that step of operations. Or control a vehicle and the vehicle's systems knowing your intent as a backup to your control inputs.

Though;

***I would rather die than live in the world that technology like this will do for the average person***

This will be the future scandal of Guantánamo Bay / Abu Gharib for this technology:

If it's AI, you're using Machine Learning, classically known as ""Statistical Learning"". Machine/statistical learning is based on statistics, obviously. So even if we're '99.9% sure' (which can only be derived from past analyses, anyway) you're thinking about the location of Saddam Hussein's WMD, we can't be sure they exist.

And, because it's digital, it's prone to hacking. People can learn to think in different patterns, similar to how small noise in digital images can disrupt convolutional neural networks. Or, some other human error/intervention could render the results meaningless, perhaps the person was thinking ""Saddam has no weapons of mass destruction"", but a minor glitch changed the ""no"" to ""yes"", etc. The last thing we want is another testimonial from Nayirah:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_testimony

but in this case with false claims of mind reading instead of babies in incubators

This type of technology should really see limited use in legal or military fields, and should probably only have applications in research and medicine.

***The dangerous thing about this technology is not that it might eventually be good enough to read your thoughts. Enough is enough if the technology gets good enough to convince others that it can read your thoughts***

This ""technology"" has existed. It's a bait item, different parts of the brain process different emotions/feelings. He is not able to read thoughts.

but it goes... Unless they develop another technology that can mimic fMRI and be much more accurate. You won't have to worry about this in particular. Worry More About Anti-Vaccines, Left/Rightists, and Mass Pollution","{""2024-05-04T23:56:26"":8}",true,
j1gb2rk,ztzcpd,singularity,t1_j1g8h95,ep1p8jyq,2022-12-24 03:55:13+00,"I think that autonomous cars that can be seen on the road is already something plausible in some cities, and in the next 5 years it will be more and more common.

But autonomous driving poses some big challenges that are difficult to solve:

⚫ Coexistence with human chaos: On a road with only autonomous cars, everything will work practically perfectly. The problem lies in adding the complexity involved in a road where there will be autonomous cars and cars driven by people, who are all but objective in our actions.

⚫ Legislation: As is often the case, it is several steps behind innovation. An autonomous car has to continually face moral challenges, and that entails the need to establish an adequate legal system. In the event of an accident, would the fault lie with the owner of the vehicle or with the company that supplied the AI ​​algorithms that govern it? In the event of an accident, should the AI ​​save the integrity of its passengers, knowing that they are ""the client"", or objectively put the lives of the greatest number of people first, even if this means ""sacrificing"" their owners?

These are questions with difficult answers, which today are solved by arguing in human subjectivity. But when said subjectivity is conspicuous by its absence, that ""mens rea"" arises, which is not considered as such at an ethical and legal level in our societies.

So as they said above, there will be more and more autonomous cars, but I am skeptical to think that in just five years they will be the norm.

And to this we must add purely social factors that must change, such as the fear of losing control behind the wheel, or the need felt by a considerable percentage of society to own a vehicle.

Rather, it will be a matter of gradual expansions, which will cover several decades, to perhaps in the future leave driving behind and enjoy as we do some of the pleasure of having third parties do it. In this case, pure algorithms.

I think there is a long tail of complicated situations. It's easy to think we're almost there when you can get to 98% quickly and 99% with some effort. But you really need 99.999999%

However, real progress is being made. Waymo is rolling out the service more widely, Tesla FSD is getting better...and I'm sure there are a lot of changes being made to model architectures, labeling processes, hardware upgrades, etc. and you can call some of them previews if you want...

That is all. We don't have general artificial intelligence yet. This means that many scenarios are completely new to the machine. So you have to solve this long tail case by case.

This is how we do NOT train drivers. You expect people to be able to resolve many of these situations on their own. At some point this connects with all other aspects of being human.

If a rabbid raccoon stands in front of the car with a machine gun, this probably wouldn't trigger the expected action because the ML driving has no concept of aggression, doesn't have a database of raccoon biology, and isn't involved. in the debate on gun violence. It only has a limited number of parameters such as similarity to a bicycle, position in space, and motion vector.

I don't remember the driving instructor telling me what to do in this scenario, but if I run into the bastard, I'll run to him.

It remains to be seen if we have to wait for GI to have self-driving cars or if we can force the list of scenarios.

What is the problem? Humans, dogs, cats, all sorts of unpredictable things... and one predictable thing if cars drive themselves and humans are supposed to be ready to take over if the car can't drive, they won't. , but they will be seated. there on the internet, watching Netflix or doing my makeup.

Then there's the whole ethics thing, what if a crash is inevitable? You can only choose what you hit, that is, between a pedestrian or another, a car, a bus, school children, etc.

Personally, I think fully autonomous flying vehicles are a much easier problem to solve.

the best ""model"" that the autonomous car has of other cars and pedestrians is that these are ""moving obstacles"". and the way you drive a self-driving car is to ""move one way (as indicated by Google map) towards the destination while avoiding these moving obstacles."" this works for the most part. however . . .

- someone standing waiting to cross the street? better stay far away from them, IN CASE they start to walk.

- A traffic cop who says ""come here"" with a wave of his hand? better not go towards them, because autonomous cars do not understand hand gestures.

- a car parked on the side of the road with its emergency flashers on? well it doesn't mean anything so I'll be driving really close to him anyway and omg all of a sudden a moving human obstacle appeared next to him where did he come from?

So as a result these cars behave in very strange ways whenever human encounters or communications are required to make a move, which happens in abundance in a city. I'm no expert in the field, but it seems highway driving is for the most part reasonable and commercially available.

that is next to the problem of misrecognizing things in the street.

***Autonomous driving on a highway is not really that difficult. I think it will soon be commercial with trucks. A highway is a fairly structured environment. As if your robot works in the laboratory, where everything is perfectly configured. A road is like an information sanitized environment because humans don't live there. But off-road? You have to be prepared to see and do anything. Humans will do anything and your self-driving car will see everything***

Serif-driveing ​​falls into the singularly difficult category of solution spaces where AI finds a large number of low-probability events. This has limited the effectiveness of the solutions. New approaches are being developed all the time and we are improving all the time, but this is a difficult problem that more data doesn't necessarily solve. It requires the ability to extrapolate from previous experience in a much larger way than other solution spaces.

I feel like all cars should become autonomous for the concept to work. Human errors are unavoidable on the road, and it can be difficult for a computer to take precise action against them.

I want to see the concept of autonomous driving as a colony of ants. Everyone knows which vehicles are in which range. However, going fully digital also has its downsides, such as being hacked and modded. But I think the benefits outweigh the negatives in the long run.

The fundamental hurdle to autonomous driving is the prediction part: predicting what traffic participants will do (or try to do) next, and then taking action to achieve a goal safely, in a way that does not result in legal liability. in the event of a crash/collision.

In fact, we are currently struggling to get the sensing part to work properly (to achieve 99.99999999999999999999% accuracy and recall levels in the operational design domain (ODD), which are necessary for critical closed-loop systems for security), but IMHO it's more of a technology/cost issue that I think can be solved with the right sensors/data/V2X etc.

However, the decision-making part under uncertainty is the fundamental obstacle. I personally doubt that we will be able to solve this problem in our lifetimes. I think to figure this out, we need to better understand our mind (how it makes decisions, how it interacts with reality, etc.).

Instead of spending billions on self-driving cars that pollute so much and are only available to the rich, we should just build public transportation, help everyone, and get cars off the road. You don't have to drive them yourself either.

Three things must happen for this;

⚫ Being able to pack enough computing power into a car.

⚫ Making that power and all the necessary sensors affordable

Those are the easy ones. They could be achievable in a couple of decades.

⚫ Discover how to make Artificial General Intelligence. Right now, nobody knows. It takes fundamental in AI and advanced understanding of how the human brain works. They don't even know which paths they need to take for the research to get there. Lots of people are working on it, but no one knows when, or if, we'll get there.

The state of human driving ability would probably not be good enough to be acceptable to the AI. People die in the streets every day. Humans make mistakes, even experienced ones. We accept that and punish people who drive recklessly. But would we accept people dying every day due to AI glitches? I do not think. We cannot punish the AI. We probably can't punish companies either because they would go bankrupt pretty quickly. We expect the AI ​​to work perfectly. And this might never be achievable. There will always be situations where fatalities are unavoidable. After all, there are other participants in traffic besides cars. **There is no magic in human brains, but there is no magic in computers either**

Truly autonomous cars were great. But all this hype has more to do with car sales than safety.

Time is not a problem for the autonomous vehicle, in a fully automated environment, a reliable and safe system could be offered in a decade.

The problem is the miscegenation of the structure and the uncontrollable behavior of vehicles driven by a human being, which are a headache for the programming of autonomous driving.","{""2024-05-04T23:56:26"":10}",false,
j1exjsc,ztbt7o,singularity,t1_j1dpn6v,ep1p8jyq,2022-12-23 21:27:49+00,"The difference between the year 2000 and the year 2022 is extraordinary. I'm not sure you can really round to the nearest thousand.

It is crazy how many people basically saying, ""Nothing extraordinary has happened in the past twenty years or so. Not like X year compared to Y year."" or ""Take someone from twenty years ago and life would be basically the same."" Maybe it's because so many here lived it, but the world has changed. Considerably.

The very fact that profound advances have become mundane is extraordinary. Change, advancement, innovation, and progress has become so commonplace, it has become invisible unless something truly astounding comes along.

Go back to 2000, and you have a world without social media (and all the issues that come with it). MySpace was launched 2003, with Facebook 2004. 2006 for Twitter. Those have fundamentally altered society and how information is consumed, for good and ill.

Streaming. We have completely altered how we consume media. Music, movies, TV shows. So much entertainment is available for far cheaper than ever before.

YouTube wasn't a thing until 2005. That alone has revolutionized the world. Beyond the sharing of videos and content created, the ability to get visual guides to so many things is astounding. Video tutorials have made picking up new skills easier than ever. Learning in general has completely changed. Khan Academy, Skill Share, Brilliant, etc. You can learn just about anything in a dozen different ways. Students can use photo math to solve complex math problems in seconds.

Phones. The iPhone completely upended the mobile phone market. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and are the primary way many people around the world connect to the internet. All the infrastructure that supports the mobile industry is astounding, from paying per text message of yesteryear to unlimited 5G data plans.

GPS. I still remember having to print out Map Quest directions. Then, you needed expensive specialized units. Now everyone with a smartphone has access to GPS directions. Going beyond that, you can get traffic alerts, accident reroutes, speed trap information, etc.

Tablets and E-readers. For a book lover like me, the amount of books I have access to is astounding. It's like walking around with an entry library in your bag. You can watch movies on them, surf the web, work, etc.

Medical technology. CRISPER, mRNA vaccines, new procedures like laparoscopic surgery, mapping the human genome, etc.

Solar and wind technology, as well as developments in battery technology. Yeah, batteries aren't ""there"" yet in terms of where we want them, but they have been improving. Solar and wind technologies have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past twenty years.

SpaceX is landing rockets. Reusable rockets. We just launched one of the most sophisticated piece of engineering in the form of the James Webb Space Telescope recently that lets us look farther and clearer than ever before. We just launched one of the most powerful rockets ever built (SLS) with another, even more powerful, one getting ready (starship). We are going back to the Moon soon with plans to stay there. Space tourism is a thing now.

These are just some big things off the top of my head. Little things have also changed, yet we don't notice them despite completely changing how we operate. Self checkouts. How we tap or insert credit cards instead of swiping (or just using our phone to pay). Online shopping. Curbside pickup. Ride share like Uber/Lyft and other gig economy things like food delivery. Not memorizing phone numbers since they are in contacts. Having a camera and video recorder in our pockets, ready to go at a moments notice. Bigger, better TVs are cheaper than ever. Cloud... everything; from saving photos to word processing, so much stuff is seamlessly integrated between phone, laptop, tablet, and computer. Online dating. Spell check and grammar help. Podcasts. How texting and messaging overtook phone calls as the primary form of communication. Look at how advanced cars have gotten, backup cams, blind spot detection, smart keys, electric vehicles, etc.

If we stop and look around today, we can see so many things on the horizon that have the potential to change the world, yet are nothing more than headlines to skim over because, ultimately, they are one of dozens of 'marvels' happening in the same period of time.

Fusion got a big bit of news recently. People joke about how it is always ""thirty years away"" but progress is being made. ITER is planned to be finished in 2025, which may be huge as well.

Machine learning has exploded in the past year or so. AI has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but now it is starting to become visible. AI art and the new chatbot has been making waves recently, and the rate of improvement is astounding. People laugh now at some of the goofs it makes, but it's only going to get better as the technology matures.

3D printing is another one. It's around now of course, but the things it can do is only going to grow as time passes.

Medicine is constantly improving too. New drugs and procedures make a world of difference to many that is largely ignored or invisible to the people who it doesn't affect.

So much more, but I think I've made my point.

To all those who say the world hasn't changed or nothing ""extraordinary"" has happened in the past twenty years really drives home how extraordinary this time in human history is. Revolutionary, society shifting technology that would dominate the public attention back in the 20th century has become so normalized, they are nothing more than a headline you scroll past and maybe think, ""Huh.

Art is an ephemeral thing, it's not a tangible thing, it's not quantifiable. There's no **real** exploitation involved. Moreover, it's for ANYONE to use, including said artists. ML expands the available toolset for artists, not trying to replace them. Those who will adapt it and pioneer their new approach, just like with animation made with digital software, will succeed, those who reject it will be left behind. It's really that fucking simple.

Moreover, it gives an ability to those who lack means to express their passions in traditional ways, for one reason or another.

Whatever ""morally-ethically"" correct idea you are trying to preach, you are barking at the wrong tree, and the only elites needed to be taken down are the big corpos who will inevitably consolidate the tech and try to restrict it to all the common folk, while freely using it themselves however the fuck they want, power-hungry bastards that they are.
