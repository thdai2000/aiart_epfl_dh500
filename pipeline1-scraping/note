1. subreddit selection: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bfOt5vxLwRjfIpzZbIOWiLEwDUm597aPcZ0_DiPPQKA/edit?usp=drive_link
    we search posts that are relevant to our goal, and collect their subreddits
2. classify subreddits as "art", "tech", or "others", and scrape their submissions
3. filtered these submission ids by matching keywords on submission title / descritpion
4. use these submission ids to scrape all the comments (2 tiers)
5. filter comments using keyword matching
    art_pattern = r'\b(?:art|arts)\b|artist|music|paint|film|animation|graphic|sculpture|design'

    ai_pattern = r'\b(?:ai)\b|generat|digital|algorithm|computation|machine'

    if re.search(ai_pattern, text, flags=re.IGNORECASE) and re.search(art_pattern, text, flags=re.IGNORECASE):
       return True
    else:
       return False
6. preprocessing (put in pipeline 2)
    only keep comments that are more than 15 and less than 256 words
    mask url
